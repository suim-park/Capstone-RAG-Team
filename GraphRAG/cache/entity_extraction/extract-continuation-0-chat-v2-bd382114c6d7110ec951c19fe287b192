A total of 380 patients were randomized to receive hydrocortisone (n = 190) or placebo (n = 190). The median time from screening to enrollment was 12.5 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 6-21 hours) in the placebo group and 14 hours (IQR, 6.5-23 hours) in the hydrocortisone group (P = .49). The ITT population excluded 27 patients and included 353 patients (64.9% male; mean [SD] age, 65.0 [14.4] years) (Figure 1). The PP population consisted of 322 patients, and the safety analysis set included 375 patients. Six patients (2 in the placebo group, 4 in the hydrocortisone group) received a reduced dose (<80% of total dose according to protocol). Ten patients (5 in the placebo group, 5 in the hydrocortisone group) received an increased dose (quotient of applied dose and expected dose >1.2). These patients were excluded from the PP analysis. Follow-up was conducted until February 23, 2014.\n\nBaseline Characteristics and Treatment During Study\nTreatment arms were comparable regarding age, type of admission to the ICU, severity of disease or organ dysfunction, use of glucocorticoids or etomidate within 72 hours before randomization, initial treatment and vital signs within 6 hours after diagnosis of severe sepsis, administration of study medication, antibiotic therapy, and treatment characteristics during the study. Pneumonia was slightly more frequent in patients who received placebo (Table 1 and eTables 1, 2, and 3 in Supplement 1).\n\nPrimary End Point\nThere was no significant difference in the proportion of septic shock after 14 days between patients who received hydrocortisone or placebo in the ITT or PP population (Table 2). In the ITT population, septic shock occurred in 36 of 170 patients (21.2%) in the hydrocortisone group vs 39 of 170 patients (22.9%) in the placebo group (difference, −1.8%; 95% CI, −10.7% to 7.2%; P = .70). In the PP population, septic shock occurred in 29 of 155 patients (18.7%) in the hydrocortisone group vs 33 of 156 patients (21.2%) in the placebo group (difference, −2.4%; 95% CI, −11.5% to 6.6%; P = .59). In addition, no significant difference between the groups was observed regarding time to septic shock development (Figure 2), or in time to septic shock in those patients who developed septic shock (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Subgroup analysis of medical or surgical patients, patients with pneumonia, or study medication treatment for at least 48 hours did not reveal a benefit for shock prevention (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). To exclude a center effect, 11 sites that recruited at least 10 patients (n = 279) were analyzed; there was no heterogeneity for the primary end point (I2 = 0%; P = .74).\n\nSecondary End Points\nThere were no significant differences in 28-day, 90-day, 180-day, ICU, or hospital all-cause mortality; LOS in the ICU or hospital; ventilation- or renal replacement–free days; or median SOFA score until day 14 between patients treated with placebo or hydrocortisone (Table 2 and eFigure 3 in Supplement 1). At 28 days, mortality occurred in 15 of 171 patients (8.8%) in the hydrocortisone group and 14 of 170 patients (8.2%) in the placebo group (difference, 0.5%; 95% CI, −5.6% to 6.7%; P = .86). At 90 days, mortality occurred in 34 of 171 patients (19.9%) in the hydrocortisone group vs 28 of 168 patients (16.7%) in the placebo group (difference, 3.2%; 95% CI, −5.1% to 11.4%; P = .44). At 180 days, mortality occurred in 45 of 168 patients (26.8%) in the hydrocortisone group vs 37 of 167 patients (22.2%) in the placebo group (difference, 4.6%; 95% CI, −4.6% to 13.7%; P = .32). Analysis of the PP population revealed no significant differences for secondary end points between the treatment arms. A post hoc analysis of 54 patients with CAP did not reveal significant differences for the primary or secondary end points between patients treated with hydrocortisone (n = 24) or placebo (n = 30).\n\nAdverse Effects\nThere were more episodes of hyperglycemia (blood glucose level >150 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]) in the hydrocortisone group (169 of 186 patients [90.9%]) than in the placebo group (154 of 189 patients\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SEVERE SEPSIS OR SEPTIC SHOCK STUDY<|>EVENT<|>A clinical study conducted from 2009 to 2013 involving 9953 patients screened at 34 sites to evaluate the effects of hydrocortisone versus placebo in severe sepsis or septic shock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A treatment administered to 190 patients in the study to assess its impact on severe sepsis or septic shock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLACEBO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A control treatment administered to 190 patients in the study to compare its effects with hydrocortisone in severe sepsis or septic shock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTENTION-TO-TREAT (ITT) POPULATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of 353 patients included in the study analysis, excluding 27 patients, to evaluate the primary and secondary endpoints)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PER-PROTOCOL (PP) POPULATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of 322 patients included in the study analysis to evaluate the primary and secondary endpoints)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAFETY ANALYSIS SET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of 375 patients included in the study to assess safety outcomes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEBRUARY 23, 2014<|>EVENT<|>The date when follow-up for the study was conducted)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEVERE SEPSIS OR SEPTIC SHOCK STUDY<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>Hydrocortisone was one of the treatments evaluated in the study<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEVERE SEPSIS OR SEPTIC SHOCK STUDY<|>PLACEBO<|>Placebo was used as a control treatment in the study<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEVERE SEPSIS OR SEPTIC SHOCK STUDY<|>INTENTION-TO-TREAT (ITT) POPULATION<|>The ITT population was part of the study's analysis<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEVERE SEPSIS OR SEPTIC SHOCK STUDY<|>PER-PROTOCOL (PP) POPULATION<|>The PP population was part of the study's analysis<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEVERE SEPSIS OR SEPTIC SHOCK STUDY<|>SAFETY ANALYSIS SET<|>The safety analysis set was part of the study's analysis<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEVERE SEPSIS OR SEPTIC SHOCK STUDY<|>FEBRUARY 23, 2014<|>The study follow-up was conducted until this date<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
