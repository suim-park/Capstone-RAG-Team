Details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\nStudy Treatments\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive either 20% albumin and crystalloid solution (albumin group) or crystalloid solution alone (crystalloid group) from randomization until day 28 or discharge from the ICU, whichever came first. During the early phase of volume resuscitation, fluids were administered in both groups according to early goal-directed therapy.15\nAfter randomization, patients in the albumin group received 300 ml of 20% albumin solution. From day 1 until day 28 or ICU discharge (whichever came first), 20% albumin was administered on a daily basis, to maintain a serum albumin level of 30 g per liter or more. In both groups, crystalloids were administered whenever it was clinically indicated by the attending physician. The administration of synthetic colloids was not allowed. All other treatments were at the discretion of the attending physician.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome measure was death from any cause at 28 days after randomization. The principal secondary outcome measure was death from any cause at 90 days after randomization. Additional secondary outcomes were the number of patients with organ dysfunction and the degree of dysfunction and the length of stay in the ICU and the hospital. The severity of systemic illness was assessed with the use of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score, with scores ranging from 0 to 163 and higher scores indicating more severe illness.16 Organ function was assessed daily with the use of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score,17 which ranges from 0 to 4 for each of five components (respiratory, coagulation, liver, cardiovascular, and renal components), with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). New organ failures were defined as a change in a component score during the study from a baseline score of 0, 1, or 2 to a score of 3 or 4.5,18,19 Tertiary outcomes, which were assessed in post hoc analyses, included the use of renal-replacement therapy, the incidence of acute kidney injury, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the time to suspension of the administration of vasopressor or inotropic agents.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe originally determined that a sample of 1350 patients would provide the study with 80% power to detect an absolute between-group difference of 7.5 percentage points in mortality at 28 days, on the basis of an estimated baseline mortality of 45%, with a two-sided P value of less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance. The study protocol specified the possibility of increasing the sample to 1800 patients on the basis of a recommendation by the data and safety monitoring board during an interim analysis.\nAll the analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Binary outcomes were compared with the use of the chi-square test, and continuous outcomes with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Comparisons of fluid volumes and physiological data over time were performed with the use of a two-factor analysis of variance for repeated measurements. We calculated survival estimates according to the Kaplan–Meier method and compared them using a log-rank test. We performed an adjusted analysis using robust Poisson regression for binary outcomes. In a post hoc analysis, the primary and principal secondary outcomes were assessed in patients who had septic shock and those who did not have septic shock at the time of enrollment. Heterogeneity of treatment effects among subgroups was assessed with the use of the test for a common relative risk. SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute), was used for all the analyses.\nResults\nStudy Population\nFrom August 2008 through February 2012, a total of 1818 patients with severe sepsis were randomly assigned to receive 20% albumin and crystalloid solution (910 patients) or crystalloid solution alone (908) for fluid replacement. Per protocol, patient enrollment was stratified according to the interval between the time the patient met the clinical criteria for severe sepsis and randomization: 6 hours or less (579 patients [31.8%]) versus more than 6 hours (1239 [68.2%]). A total of 8 patients were excluded from the analysis (2 patients in the albumin group owing to withdrawal of consent, and 5 in the albumin group and 1 in the crystalloid group owing to a randomization error) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nAfter follow-up, data regarding death at 90 days were available for 888 of 903 patients (98.3%) in the albumin group and for 893 of 907 (98.5%) in the crystalloid group. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two study groups, except for a slight imbalance in the number of patients with organ dysfunction and values of central venous oxygen saturation (Table 1). The primary site of infection, the type of identified microorganism, and the proportion of patients receiving antibiotics were similar in the two groups (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\nFluid Therapy and Treatment Effects\nDuring the first 7 days, the albumin group, as compared with the crystalloid group, received a significantly larger volume of 20% albumin solution (P<0.001) and less crystalloid solution (P<0.001). In the albumin group, the administration of 20\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
