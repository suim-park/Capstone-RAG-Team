After adjustment for multiple comparisons, there was no significant between-group difference in the number of days alive and out of the ICU (P=0.047; threshold level for significance after adjustment for multiple comparisons, P=0.005) (Table 2, and Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nPatients in the hydrocortisone group had a shorter duration of the initial episode of mechanical ventilation than did those in the placebo group (median, 6 days [interquartile range, 3 to 18] vs. 7 days [interquartile range, 3 to 24]; hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.22; P<0.001), but taking into account episodes of recurrence of ventilation, there were no significant differences in the number of days alive and free from mechanical ventilation (Table 2, and Fig. S6G and S6H in the Supplementary Appendix).\nThere were no significant between-group differences with respect to the rate of recurrence of shock, the time to hospital discharge, the number of days alive and out of hospital, the rate of recurrence of mechanical ventilation, the duration and rate of use of renal-replacement therapy, and the rate of development of new-onset bacteremia or fungemia (Table 2, and Fig. S6E and S6F in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFewer patients in the hydrocortisone group than in the placebo group received a blood transfusion (37.0% vs. 41.7%; odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94; P=0.004). Among the patients who received a transfusion, there was no significant between-group difference with respect to the mean total volume of blood transfused (Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nAdverse Events\nA total of 33 adverse events was reported in the trial population, with a higher percentage in the hydrocortisone group than in the placebo group (1.1% vs. 0.3%, P=0.009). There were 6 serious adverse events, with 4 occurring in the hydrocortisone group and 2 in the placebo group (Table 3). The list of protocol violations and the results of the interim analyses are presented in Tables S12 and S13, respectively, in the Supplementary Appendix.\nTable 3\n\nAdverse Events.\nDiscussion\nWe found that the administration of hydrocortisone did not result in lower 90-day mortality than placebo among patients with septic shock. This effect did not differ in any of the six prespecified subgroups. We observed a more rapid resolution of shock and a lower incidence of blood transfusion among patients who received hydrocortisone than among those who received placebo. Patients who had been assigned to receive hydrocortisone had a shorter time to ICU discharge and earlier cessation of the initial episode of mechanical ventilation than did those who had been assigned to receive placebo. There were no significant between-group differences with respect to mortality at 28 days, the rate of recurrence of shock, the number of days alive and out of the ICU or hospital, the duration and rate of recurrence of mechanical ventilation, the rate of use of renal-replacement therapy, or the rate of new-onset bacteremia or fungemia. Patients who had been assigned to receive hydrocortisone had more adverse events than did those who had been assigned to receive placebo, but these events did not affect patient-centered outcomes.\nOur pragmatic trial was designed with statistical power to detect a clinically plausible effect on mortality. To reduce bias, we used a central randomization process and ensured the concealment and blinding of trial-group assignments, which were independently verified. We published our statistical analysis plan before unblinding.\nWe chose 90-day mortality as a patient-centered primary outcome and specifically targeted a population of patients who had high requirements for vital organ support (use of mechanical ventilation and ≥4 hours of vasopressor therapy before randomization) and a substantial risk of death. The trial was successful in enrolling the intended population.\nA high proportion of eligible patients received the trial intervention as planned, and few enrolled patients were lost to follow-up. The ratio of patients who underwent randomization to those who were eligible for inclusion was high: 0.69:1, a ratio that approaches that seen in other large-scale trials.29 The inclusion of 69 sites in five countries increases the external validity of the results.\nOur trial differs from previously published trials in several respects.10,11 We administered hydrocortisone by means of continuous infusion, because such a plan has been shown to attenuate the inflammatory response and reverse shock.30 Practice guidelines for septic shock suggest that infusions may minimize potentially harmful metabolic effects of glucocorticoids.15,31 A tapering strategy was not used for the discontinuation of glucocorticoids, because a beneficial effect of these agents on survival was previously reported without tapering.10 A recent study that compared abrupt cessation with a tapering strategy showed no benefits from tapering.32 We did not perform corticotropin testing, because its interpretation in critically ill patients is controversial33-35 and such testing is not recommended in current clinical practice guidelines.15 We excluded patients who had received etomidate before randomization. We did not administer fludrocortisone, because it\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The group of patients in the trial who received hydrocortisone treatment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The group of patients in the trial who received a placebo treatment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICU<|>GEO<|>Intensive Care Unit where patients were treated and monitored)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADVERSE EVENTS<|>EVENT<|>Unintended and harmful events reported during the trial, with a higher percentage in the hydrocortisone group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>EVENT<|>A severe and potentially fatal condition that was the focus of the trial)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE GROUP<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>The trial compared the effects of hydrocortisone versus placebo on patients with septic shock<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE GROUP<|>ADVERSE EVENTS<|>The hydrocortisone group experienced a higher percentage of adverse events compared to the placebo group<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>ADVERSE EVENTS<|>The placebo group experienced fewer adverse events compared to the hydrocortisone group<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE GROUP<|>ICU<|>Patients in the hydrocortisone group had a shorter time to ICU discharge<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>ICU<|>Patients in the placebo group had a longer time to ICU discharge compared to the hydrocortisone group<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE GROUP<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>The hydrocortisone group was part of a trial to assess treatment effects on septic shock<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>The placebo group was part of a trial to assess treatment effects on septic shock<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
