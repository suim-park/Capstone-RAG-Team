All safety analyses were conducted in the population of treated patients.\nResults\nStudy Patients\nAggregate mortality after recruitment of 750 patients was 27.6%. Therefore, we increased the sample size to 1696 on May 12, 2010. Patients were enrolled from March 2008 through August 2011 at 208 sites in Europe, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, and India (for details, see the Supplementary Appendix). From 27,816 potential patients, we recruited 1697, with 852 assigned to receive DrotAA and 845 assigned to receive placebo. We were able to evaluate the primary outcome in 1680 patients (99.0%) (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\n\nScreening, Randomization, and Follow-up of the Study Patients.\nA total of 71.7% of patients were recruited at European sites and 14.1% at North American sites, with 14.2% recruited from other countries. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix): 56.4% of the patients were men, and the mean (±SD) ages were 63.4±15.4 years in the DrotAA group versus 62.7±16.4 years in the placebo group. The mean APACHE II scores were 25.2±8.1 and 25.5±8.1 in the DrotAA and placebo groups, respectively; 84.1% of the patients had dysfunction of three or more organs.\nThe site of infection, cultured organisms, and antimicrobial treatments were similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The most common sites of infection were the lung, abdomen, and urinary tract. A causative pathogen was identified before starting study treatment in 1198 of 1696 patients (70.6%); 509 of 1696 patients (30.0%) had positive blood cultures. The median time from the initiation of antibiotics to initial vasopressor therapy was 2.5 hours (interquartile range, 0 to 7.1) in the DrotAA group and 2.5 hours (interquartile range, 0 to 8.6) in the placebo group (P=0.98). The control of infection at the presumed source was accomplished in 275 of 303 patients (90.8%) in the DrotAA group and 264 of 295 (89.5%) in the placebo group (P=0.60).\nTable 1\n\nSite and Cause of Infection.\nStudy Treatment and Cointerventions\nStudy treatment was administered to 1666 of 1696 patients (98.2%) and was interrupted at least once in 593 of 1666 patients (35.6%). The mean total duration of study treatment was 83.3±26.7 hours in the DrotAA group and 85.1±25.1 hours in the placebo group. The major reason for interrupting a study treatment was an invasive procedure (in 215 of 306 patients with interruptions [70.3%] in the DrotAA group vs. 238 of 287 [82.9%] in the placebo group). Study treatment was stopped prematurely in 216 of 833 patients (25.9%) in the DrotAA group and 191 of 833 (22.9%) in the placebo group. In the two groups, the most common reason for premature discontinuation was the patient's death (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The proportions of patients receiving glucocorticoids and anticoagulants were also similar in the two groups, as were the number and site of surgical procedures performed during the treatment period (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nOutcomes\nThe status of patients at 28 days is provided in Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix. At 28 days, 223 of 846 patients (26.4%) in the DrotAA group and 202 of 834 (24.2%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk in the DrotAA group, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.28; P=0.31). At 90 days, 287 of 842 patients (34.1%) in the DrotAA group and 269 of 822 (32.7%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.19; P=0.56) (Table 2). In addition, the time-to-event analysis at 90 days showed similar results (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.26; P=0.43 by the log-rank test) (Figure 2A). There was no significant heterogeneity in the treatment effect on mortality at 28 days and 90 days in the prespecified subgroups (Figure 2B, and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Changes in organ function during the 7-day study period did not differ significantly in the two groups (Table 2). Protein C activity increased from baseline during the first 6 days in both groups; the mean increase was significantly greater in patients in the DrotAA group than in the placebo group on each of the first 4 study days (P<0.001) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nProbability of Survival and Odds Ratios for Death, According to Subgroup.\nTable 2\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EUROPE<|>GEO<|>Europe is a continent where 71.7% of the study patients were recruited for the clinical trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH AMERICA<|>GEO<|>North America is a continent where 14.1% of the study patients were recruited for the clinical trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH AMERICA<|>GEO<|>South America is a continent where some of the study patients were recruited for the clinical trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>Australia is a country where some of the study patients were recruited for the clinical trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW ZEALAND<|>GEO<|>New Zealand is a country where some of the study patients were recruited for the clinical trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>India is a country where some of the study patients were recruited for the clinical trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DROTAA<|>EVENT<|>DrotAA is a treatment administered to patients in the clinical trial to evaluate its effect on mortality and organ function)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLACEBO<|>EVENT<|>Placebo is a control treatment administered to patients in the clinical trial to compare its effects with DrotAA)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPE<|>DROTAA<|>Europe was a major recruitment site for patients receiving DrotAA in the clinical trial<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH AMERICA<|>DROTAA<|>North America was a recruitment site for patients receiving DrotAA in the clinical trial<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH AMERICA<|>DROTAA<|>South America was a recruitment site for patients receiving DrotAA in the clinical trial<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|>DROTAA<|>Australia was a recruitment site for patients receiving DrotAA in the clinical trial<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW ZEALAND<|>DROTAA<|>New Zealand was a recruitment site for patients receiving DrotAA in the clinical trial<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIA<|>DROTAA<|>India was a recruitment site for patients receiving DrotAA in the clinical trial<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPE<|>PLACEBO<|>Europe was a major recruitment site for patients receiving placebo in the clinical trial<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH AMERICA<|>PLACEBO<|>North America was a recruitment site for patients receiving placebo in the clinical trial<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH AMERICA<|>PLACEBO<|>South America was a recruitment site for patients receiving placebo in the clinical trial<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|>PLACEBO<|>Australia was a recruitment site for patients receiving placebo in the clinical trial<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW ZEALAND<|>PLACEBO<|>New Zealand was a recruitment site for patients receiving placebo in the clinical trial<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIA<|>PLACEBO<|>India was a recruitment site for patients receiving placebo in the clinical trial<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
