The total amount of administered insulin was not significantly different between the hydrocortisone and placebo groups (safety set analysis: mean [SD], 264.6 [312.2] vs 212.2 [246.8] IU, respectively; difference, 52.4 IU; 95% CI, −21.8 to 126.7 IU; P = .17) (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Two patients developed severe hypertension during hydrocortisone administration, which required antihypertensive therapy. Both patients recovered without sequelae. Secondary infections, weaning failure, muscle weakness, hypernatremia, or other adverse events were not significantly different between treatment groups (Table 3).\n\nCritical Illness–Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency\nCortisol data from corticotropin tests were available from 206 of 353 patients (58.4%), of whom 69 (33.5%) had CIRCI. Baseline characteristics were comparable between patients with and without CIRCI (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). In the placebo group, septic shock occurred in 10 of 37 patients with CIRCI (27.0%) and in 9 of 66 patients without CIRCI (13.6%) (difference, 13.4%; 95% CI, −2.1% to 30.5%; P = .09). In a multivariate analysis, SOFA score (per SOFA point: odds ratio = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.07-1.49; P = .007) and CIRCI (odds ratio = 2.58; 95% CI, 1.13-5.91; P = .03) at baseline, but not age or sex, were independently prognostic for development of septic shock (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). In this subpopulation of 206 patients, there was no significant difference regarding the primary or secondary end points between patients with or without CIRCI who received hydrocortisone or placebo (eTable 6 in Supplement 1).\n\nDelirium\nDelirium was assessed by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU in 286 of 353 patients (81.0%). The median number of assessments per patient was 7 (IQR, 4-12) in the placebo group and 6.5 (IQR, 4-10.5) in the hydrocortisone group (difference, 1.61 assessments; 95% CI, −0.36 to 3.58 assessments; P = .21). Twenty-six patients were excluded from analysis owing to low Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score or incomplete data. In the remaining 260 patients, delirium was less frequent in patients who received hydrocortisone than in those who received placebo (11 of 130 patients [8.5%] vs 25 of 130 patients [19.2%], respectively; difference, −10.8%; 95% CI, −19.2% to −2.3%; P = .01). The results remained significant after exclusion of another 60 patients (28 from the placebo group, 32 from the hydrocortisone group) who were diagnosed by the investigator to have no delirium but had at least 1 incomplete delirium assessment or had only 1 baseline assessment (n = 6 in the hydrocortisone group) (with delirium occurring in 11 of 98 patients [11.2%] in the hydrocortisone group vs 25 of 102 patients [24.5%] in the placebo group; difference, −13.3%; 95% CI, −23.7% to −2.6%; P = .01) (Table 2).\n\nDiscussion\nIn this RCT, low-dose hydrocortisone did not prevent the evolution from severe sepsis to septic shock. There were no significant differences between treatment groups with regard to mortality or LOS in the ICU or hospital, or mortality up to 180 days. Patients treated with hydrocortisone had a significantly higher risk of developing hyperglycemia and a lower risk of developing delirium in a post hoc analysis.\n\nThe rationale for this study was based on the notion that severe sepsis and septic shock reflect stages of a disease continuum with increasing mortality.28 Occurrence of septic shock was chosen as the primary outcome variable for the following reasons. First, hydrocortisone in septic shock showed conflicting results in terms of mortality, but consistent hemodynamic effects and faster septic shock resolution.6,24 Second, administration of hydrocortisone was associated with immunomodulatory effects including reduced inducible nit\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hydrocortisone is a medication used in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock, with effects on hyperglycemia and delirium)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLACEBO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Placebo is a control treatment used in the study to compare effects against hydrocortisone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRITICAL ILLNESS–RELATED CORTICOSTEROID INSUFFICIENCY (CIRCI)<|>EVENT<|>CIRCI is a condition affecting cortisol levels in critically ill patients, impacting the development of septic shock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>EVENT<|>Septic shock is a severe and potentially fatal condition resulting from sepsis, characterized by significant hemodynamic effects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELERIUM<|>EVENT<|>Delirium is a condition assessed in ICU patients, with its frequency affected by hydrocortisone treatment)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>Hydrocortisone is used in the treatment of septic shock, showing hemodynamic effects and faster resolution<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>DELERIUM<|>Hydrocortisone treatment was associated with a lower risk of developing delirium<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>CRITICAL ILLNESS–RELATED CORTICOSTEROID INSUFFICIENCY (CIRCI)<|>Hydrocortisone was studied in patients with CIRCI to assess its effects on septic shock<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLACEBO<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>Placebo was used as a control to compare the effects of hydrocortisone on septic shock<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLACEBO<|>DELERIUM<|>Placebo was used as a control to compare the effects of hydrocortisone on delirium<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
