The 60-day in-hospital mortality for the combined protocol-based groups (19.5% [173 of 885 patients]) did not differ significantly from that in the usual-care group (relative risk, 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.31; P=0.83), nor did mortality differ significantly when the groups were compared separately (with P values ranging from 0.31 to 0.89) (Table 2 and Figure 2A). There were also no significant differences in 90-day mortality or in the time to death up to 90 days and 1 year (P=0.66 for 90-day mortality and P=0.70 and P=0.92 for cumulative mortality at 90 days and 1 year, respectively) (Table 2 and Figure 2B). Results were essentially unchanged when adjusted for potential site heterogeneity (odds of 60-day in-hospital death with protocol-based care vs. usual care, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.38; P=0.54).\nFigure 2\n\nCumulative Mortality.\nTable 2\n\nOutcomes.\nThe incidence of acute renal failure, as indicated by a new need for renal-replacement therapy, was higher in the protocol-based standard-therapy group than in the other two groups (6.0% in the protocol-based standard-therapy group vs. 3.1% in the protocol-based EGDT group and 2.8% in the usual-care group, P=0.04), although the duration of therapy did not differ significantly across the groups (Table 2). The rate of admission to the intensive care unit was higher in the protocol-based EGDT group than in the other two groups, although among patients who were admitted, there were no significant between-group differences in the length of stay in the intensive care unit (Table 2). There were no significant differences in the incidence and duration of cardiovascular failure or respiratory failure, nor were there significant differences in the length of stay in the hospital or the discharge disposition (Table 2).\nReports of potentially serious adverse events (excluding death) were rare and did not differ significantly across groups (Table 2, and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). There were no significant interactions between the assigned treatment and any prespecified subgroup with respect to the primary outcome of 60-day in-hospital mortality or with respect to the secondary mortality outcomes (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). Similarly, in a post hoc analysis, there was no evidence of a treatment effect within ranges of values for the APACHE II score, serum lactate level, or time from meeting the criteria for shock to randomization (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nDiscussion\nIn our study, adherence to the two experimental protocols was high, and, as expected, protocol-based care, as compared with usual care, resulted in increased use of central venous catheterization, intravenous fluids, vasoactive agents, and blood transfusions. The two protocol-based resuscitation approaches led to a small but transient improvement in blood pressure by the end of the resuscitation period but a higher requirement for intensive care and renal-replacement therapy. There were no significant differences in mortality, either overall or in a number of prespecified and post hoc subgroups.\nOur results differ from those of Rivers et al.4; however, our study was not a direct replication of that study, and there are probably several factors that contribute to the differences. Although the two trials used similar inclusion criteria, the enrolled populations differed. The study cohorts were similar with respect to many demographic and clinical characteristics, including the severity of illness (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix), but the cohort in the study by Rivers et al. was slightly older, had higher rates of preexisting heart and liver disease, and had a higher initial serum lactate level. Although we modified the minimum fluid bolus required to establish the presence of refractory hypotension, the mean volume of the bolus that was administered fell within the range used in the study by Rivers et al. (20 to 30 ml per kilogram). The mean initial ScvO2 reported by Rivers et al. was 49%, which was lower than that in the ProCESS trial. However, early central venous catheterization was considered to be part of usual care in that trial, allowing ScvO2 readings to be made before administration of the initial fluid bolus, the response to which was required to establish refractory hypotension. In contrast, for patients randomly assigned to the protocol-based EGDT group in our study, we measured ScvO2 only after the initial fluid bolus had been administered, making a direct comparison problematic. Nonetheless, the cohort in the study by Rivers et al. may have had, on average, more severe or persistent shock than the patients in our cohort. However, we were unable to show a benefit even when we restricted the analyses to the sickest third of our patients — those with the highest serum lactate levels and those with the highest APACHE II scores.\nBoth trials used the same EGDT protocol delivered by a trained, dedicated team at each site. Rivers et al. reported nearly perfect adherence but did not provide details regarding the assessment method. Although adherence to the protocol was high in our study, we cannot exclude the possibility that the outcome would have been better if adherence had been perfect. We believe that the rate of adherence in our study parallels the likely performance in any widespread effort targeting the care of patients with\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EGDT GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The protocol-based Early Goal-Directed Therapy (EGDT) group involved in a clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of a specific treatment protocol for patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STANDARD-THERAPY GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The protocol-based standard-therapy group involved in a clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of a specific treatment protocol for patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The usual-care group involved in a clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of standard treatment practices for patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIVERS ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who conducted a previous study on early goal-directed therapy, which is referenced for comparison in the current study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROCESS TRIAL<|>EVENT<|>A clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of protocol-based care versus usual care in patients with severe conditions)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT GROUP<|>STANDARD-THERAPY GROUP<|>Both groups are part of the protocol-based care in the clinical trial<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT GROUP<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>The EGDT group is compared with the usual-care group in the clinical trial<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STANDARD-THERAPY GROUP<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>The standard-therapy group is compared with the usual-care group in the clinical trial<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RIVERS ET AL.<|>PROCESS TRIAL<|>The ProCESS trial results are compared with those of the study conducted by Rivers et al.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
