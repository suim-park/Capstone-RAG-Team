In the albumin group, the administration of 20% albumin solution accounted for a median daily average of 4.3% (interquartile range, 2.9 to 5.8) of the total administered fluids. The total daily amount of administered fluids in the first 7 days did not differ significantly between the albumin group and the crystalloid group (3738 ml [interquartile range, 3174 to 4437] and 3825 ml [interquartile range, 3205 to 4533], respectively; P=0.10) (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nThe serum albumin level was significantly higher in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group from day 1 to day 28 (P<0.001) (Figure 1A). During the first 7 days, patients in the albumin group had a significantly lower heart rate than those in the crystalloid group (P=0.002), as well as a significantly higher mean arterial pressure (P=0.03) (Table S4 and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Daily net fluid balances were lower in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group (P<0.001) (Figure 1B). The median cumulative net fluid balance was also significantly lower in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group (347 ml [interquartile range, −3266 to 4042] vs. 1220 ml [interquartile range, −2767 to 5034], P=0.004) (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 1\n\nSerum Albumin Levels through Day 28 and Net Fluid Balance through Day 7.\nOutcomes\nAt 28 days after randomization, 285 of 895 patients (31.8%) in the albumin group and 288 of 900 (32.0%) in the crystalloid group had died (relative risk in the albumin group, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87 to 1.14; P=0.94) (Table 2). At 90 days of follow-up, 365 of 888 patients (41.1%) in the albumin group and 389 of 893 (43.6%) in the crystalloid group had died (relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.05; P=0.29). No significant difference in the probability of survival was observed between the albumin group and the crystalloid group during the 90 days after randomization (P=0.39) (Figure 2).\nFigure 2\n\nProbability of Survival from Randomization through Day 90.\nTable 2\n\nOutcomes.\nNo significant difference was observed between the two study groups with respect to either the number of newly developed organ failures or the median SOFA score (Table 2). Analysis of the SOFA score for each organ system revealed that, as compared with the crystalloid group, the albumin group had a lower cardiovascular score (P=0.03), a higher coagulation score (P=0.04), and a higher liver score (P=0.02). No significant differences were observed in other secondary and tertiary outcomes, with the exception of the time to suspension of the administration of vasopressor or inotropic agents, which was shorter in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group (P=0.007) (Table 2).\nIn subgroup analyses, no significant difference was observed in the prespecified subgroups that were stratified according to the interval between the time the patient met the clinical criteria for severe sepsis and randomization (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Conversely, a significant difference was observed in a post hoc subgroup analysis that included 1121 patients with septic shock, as compared with 660 without septic shock, at the time of enrollment (relative risk with septic shock, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.99; relative risk without septic shock, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.39; P=0.03 for heterogeneity) (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Adjustment for baseline covariates did not significantly modify these results (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nDiscussion\nThe main results of this large-scale trial provide evidence regarding both the efficacy and the safety of the use of human albumin during severe sepsis — an interventional strategy that has long been debated.21,22 The addition of albumin to crystalloids during the first 28 days of treatment to maintain a serum albumin level of 30 g per liter or more is safe but does not provide a survival advantage over crystalloids alone, over a follow-up period of 90 days. Similar findings were observed in the subgroup stratified according to the interval between the time the patient met the clinical criteria for severe sepsis and treatment application.\nThe findings in our trial may appear to contradict those of the predefined subgroup analysis from the SAFE study,5 which suggested a survival advantage with an albumin-based strategy during severe sepsis. The plausibility of this hypothesis was supported by the significant hemodynamic advantages observed23 and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALBUMIN GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The group of patients in the trial who received 20% albumin solution as part of their treatment for severe sepsis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRYSTALLOID GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The group of patients in the trial who received crystalloid solution as part of their treatment for severe sepsis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAFE STUDY<|>EVENT<|>A previous study that suggested a survival advantage with an albumin-based strategy during severe sepsis)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALBUMIN GROUP<|>CRYSTALLOID GROUP<|>Both groups were part of a trial comparing the efficacy and safety of albumin versus crystalloid solutions in treating severe sepsis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALBUMIN GROUP<|>SAFE STUDY<|>The trial findings for the albumin group were compared to the results of the SAFE study<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRYSTALLOID GROUP<|>SAFE STUDY<|>The trial findings for the crystalloid group were compared to the results of the SAFE study<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
