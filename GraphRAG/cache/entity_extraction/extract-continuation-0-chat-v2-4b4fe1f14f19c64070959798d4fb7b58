Data analysis for serious adverse events was performed for all patients on an intention-to-treat basis.\nStudy Outcomes\nThe primary outcome was death from any cause by 28 days after inclusion. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, days alive and free from organ dysfunction by day 28, and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital. Survival by day 28 without organ support was defined as the number of days without catecholamine infusion, mechanical ventilation, or renal-replacement therapy.14 Serious adverse events were recorded and classified as cardiac, ischemic, or other.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe determined that the enrollment of 800 patients would provide a power of 80% to show an absolute between-group difference of 10 percentage points in the primary outcome, at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, assuming a rate of death of 45%. We decided not to compensate for dropouts caused by the withdrawal of consent. All analyses were performed by the study statistician before the randomization code was broken, in line with both the International Conference on Harmonization–Good Clinical Practice guidelines and our statistical analysis plan (which is available in the protocol).\nThe analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population, which was defined as all patients who had undergone randomization except for those who did not provide consent for the use of their data. We used Cox regression models to calculate between-group differences in mortality at 28 days and 90 days. We analyzed Schoenfeld residuals to test the assumption of proportional hazards and used the Kaplan–Meier method to calculate survival curves. We expressed quantitative variables as means (±SD) and used t-tests to compare them when the sample size in each group was 30 or more (in accordance with the central limit theorem) and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test when the sample size in one group was less than 30. We used chi-square tests or Fisher's exact test to compare qualitative variables, as appropriate. All comparisons were also performed with the use of the entire sample with stratification (as prespecified) according to the presence or absence of chronic hypertension. Multiple logistic-regression analyses were conducted in the intention-to-treat population to adjust for known risk factors for acute kidney injury, such as chronic renal failure or the use of diuretics, vancomycin, aminoglycosides, iodine-containing contrast material, or long-term use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.\nInterim analyses were performed for the primary outcome of 28-day mortality, according to the Haybittle–Peto method. Statistical significance was indicated by a P value of 0.001 in the three interim analyses and a two-sided P value of 0.0492 in the final analysis. To detect a possible interaction between group and stratum covariates, logistic-regression analyses were performed for dichotomous dependent variables, whereas analysis-of-variance models were used for continuous dependent variables. All analyses were performed with the use of Stata software, version 12.1.\nResults\nStudy Population\nWe enrolled 776 patients and followed them for 90 days; we conducted the analyses according to the group to which the patients were randomly assigned (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Table S1 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Overall, 167 of 388 patients (43.0%) in the high-target group and 173 of 388 (44.6%) in the low-target group had a history of chronic hypertension. All the enrolled patients were critically ill, as defined by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, serum lactate levels, and norepinephrine infusion rates at study entry. During the 5 protocol-specified days, the mean arterial pressures in the low-target group were significantly lower than those in the high-target group, yet they exceeded the target values of 65 to 70 mm Hg (Figure 2).\nFigure 1\n\nScreening, Randomization, and Follow-up of Study Patients.\nFigure 2\n\nMean Arterial Pressure during the 5-Day Study Period.\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\nVasopressor Use and Fluid Balance\nThe infusion rates of vasopressors were significantly higher, and the duration of vasopressor treatment significantly longer, in the high-target group than in the low-target group (Table 2, and Table S2A in the Supplementary Appendix). A total of 64 patients (16.5%) in the high-target group and 40 patients (10.3%) in the low-target group (P=0.01) did not reach targets for mean arterial pressure because of the attending physician's decision to limit the vasopressor infusion rates. In 14 patients (3.6%) in the high-target group, vasopressor infusion rates were adjusted downward to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 to 70 mm Hg because of adverse effects. Values for total fluid administration and total urine output during the 5 days specified in the protocol were similar in the two study groups (Table S2B in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 2\n\nClinical Results, Primary and Secondary Outcomes, and Serious Adverse Events.\nPrimary Outcome\nAt 28 days, there was no significant between-group difference in the rate\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HARMONIZATION–GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The International Conference on Harmonization–Good Clinical Practice provides guidelines for conducting clinical trials and ensuring the integrity of data and the protection of trial subjects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATA SOFTWARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stata software, version 12.1, is a statistical software used for data analysis in this study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAYBITTLE–PETO METHOD<|>EVENT<|>The Haybittle–Peto method is a statistical approach used for interim analysis in clinical trials to determine significance levels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMPLIFIED ACUTE PHYSIOLOGY SCORE (SAPS) II<|>EVENT<|>The Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II is a scoring system used to assess the severity of a patient's condition in intensive care units)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEQUENTIAL ORGAN FAILURE ASSESSMENT (SOFA) SCORE<|>EVENT<|>The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is used to track a patient's status during their stay in an intensive care unit)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HARMONIZATION–GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE<|>STATA SOFTWARE<|>Stata software was used to perform statistical analyses in accordance with the guidelines provided by the International Conference on Harmonization–Good Clinical Practice<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAYBITTLE–PETO METHOD<|>STATA SOFTWARE<|>The Haybittle–Peto method was implemented using Stata software for interim analysis in the study<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMPLIFIED ACUTE PHYSIOLOGY SCORE (SAPS) II<|>SEQUENTIAL ORGAN FAILURE ASSESSMENT (SOFA) SCORE<|>Both the SAPS II and SOFA score were used to assess the severity of illness in patients<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
