The efficacy of hydrocortisone in patients with severe sepsis without shock remains controversial.\n\nObjective  To determine whether hydrocortisone therapy in patients with severe sepsis prevents the development of septic shock.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  Double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted from January 13, 2009, to August 27, 2013, with a follow-up of 180 days until February 23, 2014. The trial was performed in 34 intermediate or intensive care units of university and community hospitals in Germany, and it included 380 adult patients with severe sepsis who were not in septic shock.\n\nInterventions  Patients were randomly allocated 1:1 either to receive a continuous infusion of 200 mg of hydrocortisone for 5 days followed by dose tapering until day 11 (n = 190) or to receive placebo (n = 190).\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was development of septic shock within 14 days. Secondary outcomes were time until septic shock, mortality in the intensive care unit or hospital, survival up to 180 days, and assessment of secondary infections, weaning failure, muscle weakness, and hyperglycemia (blood glucose level >150 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]).\n\nResults  The intention-to-treat population consisted of 353 patients (64.9% male; mean [SD] age, 65.0 [14.4] years). Septic shock occurred in 36 of 170 patients (21.2%) in the hydrocortisone group and 39 of 170 patients (22.9%) in the placebo group (difference, −1.8%; 95% CI, −10.7% to 7.2%; P = .70). No significant differences were observed between the hydrocortisone and placebo groups for time until septic shock; mortality in the intensive care unit or in the hospital; or mortality at 28 days (15 of 171 patients [8.8%] vs 14 of 170 patients [8.2%], respectively; difference, 0.5%; 95% CI, −5.6% to 6.7%; P = .86), 90 days (34 of 171 patients [19.9%] vs 28 of 168 patients [16.7%]; difference, 3.2%; 95% CI, −5.1% to 11.4%; P = .44), and 180 days (45 of 168 patients [26.8%] vs 37 of 167 patients [22.2%], respectively; difference, 4.6%; 95% CI, −4.6% to 13.7%; P = .32). In the hydrocortisone vs placebo groups, 21.5% vs 16.9% had secondary infections, 8.6% vs 8.5% had weaning failure, 30.7% vs 23.8% had muscle weakness, and 90.9% vs 81.5% had hyperglycemia.\n\nConclusions and Relevance  Among adults with severe sepsis not in septic shock, use of hydrocortisone compared with placebo did not reduce the risk of septic shock within 14 days. These findings do not support the use of hydrocortisone in these patients.\n\nTrial Registration  clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00670254\n\nIntroduction\nDespite decades of study and debate, the role of adjunctive “low-dose” hydrocortisone treatment (200-300 mg/d) in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock remains controversial.1 The current recommendation for hydrocortisone use is mainly based on 2 randomized clinical trials (RCTs).2 In the study by Annane et al,3 hydrocortisone improved survival and reversal of septic shock in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency. In the CORTICUS study,4 septic shock was reversed more quickly but mortality was not significantly reduced. The higher risk of mortality and septic shock severity in the study by Annane and colleagues resulted in more restrictive recommendations for hydrocortisone use only in patients with inadequate response to fluid and vasopressor resuscitation.2 However, septic shock reversal in the CORTICUS study was reported to be significantly accelerated by the administration of hydrocortisone irrespective of the adrenal response to corticotropin. An international consensus statement recommended replacing the terms relative or absolute adrenal insufficiency, which reflect only adrenal cortisol release, by the critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) concept.5\n\nAlthough meta-analyses report controversial results on mortality reduction by administration of corticosteroids,6,7 there is consistency regarding shock reversal irrespective of disease severity or the presence of CIRCI.5-7 In a smaller RCT in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hydrocortisone significantly improved survival and prevented progression to shock.8 Furthermore, 2 recent RCTs9,10 and a meta-analysis11 revealed positive effects of steroids in patients with CAP. Assuming that severe sepsis and septic shock reflect a disease continuum, it was hypothesized that early hydrocortisone administration might prevent shock development owing to the attenuation of an exaggerated inflammatory response.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Surviving Sepsis Campaign is an initiative that provides guidelines for the management of sepsis and septic shock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMANY<|>GEO<|>Country where the clinical trial was conducted in 34 intermediate or intensive care units of university and community hospitals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNANE<|>PERSON<|>Researcher involved in a study that showed hydrocortisone improved survival and reversal of septic shock in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORTICUS STUDY<|>EVENT<|>A study that reported septic shock was reversed more quickly with hydrocortisone but did not significantly reduce mortality)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NCT00670254<|>EVENT<|>Clinical trial registration identifier for the study on hydrocortisone therapy in severe sepsis)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>The Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests the use of hydrocortisone in refractory septic shock<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANNANE<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>Annane's study showed that hydrocortisone improved survival and reversal of septic shock<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORTICUS STUDY<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>The CORTICUS study found that hydrocortisone reversed septic shock more quickly<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERMANY<|>NCT00670254<|>The clinical trial registered as NCT00670254 was conducted in Germany<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
