Secondary end points were time until development of septic shock or death (whichever came first), mortality in the ICU and hospital, vital status at 28, 90, and 180 days, duration of stay in the ICU and hospital, organ dysfunctions (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score, ranging from 0-24 with higher values indicating greater severity), duration of mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. In the subgroup of patients who underwent a corticotropin test at baseline, the occurrence of septic shock, mortality, length of stay (LOS) in the ICU or hospital, mechanical ventilation, organ dysfunctions (SOFA score), renal replacement therapy, and secondary infection were evaluated. Critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency was defined as an increase of cortisol of 9 µg/dL or less (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 27.588) 1 hour after stimulation with 250 µg of corticotropin (Synacthen). Frequency of delirium was assessed daily until ICU discharge by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale18,19 (ranging from −5 [unarousable; no response to voice or physical stimulation] to 4 [combative; overly combative or violent; immediate danger to staff]) to quantify the level of sedation and by the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU for detection of delirium. Adverse events were assessed until day 28, with special emphasis on muscle weakness, weaning failure, secondary infection, and gastrointestinal bleeding. All events not typically associated with the course of disease had to be reported (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1).\n\nData Acquisition, Cortisol Measurement, and Patient Treatment\nDisease severity was assessed by the SOFA score,20 Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (ranging from 0-163),21 Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (ranging from 0-71),22 and Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (ranging from 0-217) (with higher scores indicating greater severity on all instruments).23 Serum cortisol concentration was batch analyzed by mass spectrometry in a reference laboratory in blood samples stored at −80°C and taken before and 60 minutes after administration of 250 µg of corticotropin at baseline. All patients had to be treated according to guidelines of the German Sepsis Society13 (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nThe study was planned to detect an absolute difference of 15% in the proportion of patients with septic shock within 14 days with a significance level of .05 and a power of 0.8. The difference of 15% was postulated to be a meaningful difference that could change clinical practice, and was supported by similar differences of hydrocortisone on 7-day septic shock resolution in patients with septic shock,24 assuming that hydrocortisone might be as effective in preventing septic shock as in resolving it.\n\nAssuming 40% of patients in the placebo group had septic shock,8,25-27 169 evaluable patients per arm were required. Accounting for an expected dropout rate of about 10%, 190 patients per arm (380 in total) had to be included. The statistical analysis was conducted consistent with the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. The primary end point was assessed by χ2 test; heterogeneity between centers with more than 10 recruited patients was assessed by I2. Secondary end points were analyzed by χ2 test, Fisher exact test, t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or log-rank test, as appropriate. All reported P values are 2-sided, and P < .05 was regarded as statistically significant. Secondary analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing because these statistical comparisons were performed with exploratory rather than confirmatory intention. Planned subgroup analyses included the ITT population and the per-protocol (PP) population, administration of study medication for at least 48 hours, medical and surgical patients, and patients with pneumonia. Post hoc subgroup analyses were performed for CIRCI, delirium, and CAP. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to investigate adjusted treatment effects. Two interim analyses were performed after recruitment of one-third and two-thirds of the planned sample size. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc), R version 3.1.0 (R Foundation), and SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp) statistical software. For details of the statistical analyses, see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1.\n\nResults\nPatient Population\nFrom January 13, 2009, to August 27, 2013, 9953 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were screened at 34 study sites for eligibility. A total of 380 patients were randomized to receive hydrocortisone (n = 190) or placebo (n = 190). The median time from screening to enrollment was 12.5 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 6-21 hours)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Surviving Sepsis Campaign is an initiative that provides guidelines for the management of sepsis and septic shock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORTICUS STUDY<|>EVENT<|>The CORTICUS study is a clinical trial that investigated the effects of hydrocortisone on septic shock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMAN SEPSIS SOCIETY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The German Sepsis Society provides guidelines for the treatment of sepsis in Germany)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAS INSTITUTE INC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAS Institute Inc is a company that provides statistical software used in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R FOUNDATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The R Foundation supports the R project for statistical computing, which was used in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IBM CORP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IBM Corp is a multinational technology company that provides SPSS statistical software used in the study)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN<|>CORTICUS STUDY<|>The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend practices that were evaluated in the CORTICUS study<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERMAN SEPSIS SOCIETY<|>SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN<|>The German Sepsis Society guidelines align with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAS INSTITUTE INC<|>R FOUNDATION<|>Both SAS Institute Inc and the R Foundation provide statistical software used in the study<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAS INSTITUTE INC<|>IBM CORP<|>Both SAS Institute Inc and IBM Corp provide statistical software used in the study<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R FOUNDATION<|>IBM CORP<|>Both the R Foundation and IBM Corp provide statistical software used in the study<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
