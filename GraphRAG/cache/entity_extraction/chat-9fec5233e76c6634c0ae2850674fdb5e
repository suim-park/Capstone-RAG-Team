The primary outcome was death from any cause 28 days after randomization.\nResults\nAt 28 days, 223 of 846 patients (26.4%) in the DrotAA group and 202 of 834 (24.2%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk in the DrotAA group, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.28; P=0.31). At 90 days, 287 of 842 patients (34.1%) in the DrotAA group and 269 of 822 (32.7%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.19; P=0.56). Among patients with severe protein C deficiency at baseline, 98 of 342 (28.7%) in the DrotAA group had died at 28 days, as compared with 102 of 331 (30.8%) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.17; P=0.54). Similarly, rates of death at 28 and 90 days were not significantly different in other predefined subgroups, including patients at increased risk for death. Serious bleeding during the treatment period occurred in 10 patients in the DrotAA group and 8 in the placebo group (P=0.81).\nConclusions\nDrotAA did not significantly reduce mortality at 28 or 90 days, as compared with placebo, in patients with septic shock. (Funded by Eli Lilly; PROWESS-SHOCK ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00604214.)\nRecombinant human activated protein C, or drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DrotAA), was approved for the treatment of severe sepsis in 2001 on the basis of the Prospective Recombinant Human Activated Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis (PROWESS) study,1 a phase 3 international, randomized, controlled trial that was stopped early for efficacy after the enrollment of 1690 patients with severe sepsis. Absolute mortality in the intention-to-treat population was reduced by 6.1 percentage points, a relative risk reduction of 19.4%. Subsequent subgroup analysis suggested that the mortality benefit was limited to patients with increased illness severity (i.e., those with more than one sepsis-related dysfunctional organ or with an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II score2 of more than 24 [on a scale of 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating an increased risk of death]). The Food and Drug Administration limited its approval of the drug for use in patients with “a high risk of death” and requested additional trials involving less severely ill adults and children. These trials were terminated early for futility by independent data and safety monitoring committees.3,4 Moreover, subgroups of patients at increased risk for death within the adult trial did not appear to benefit from the use of DrotAA. The lack of confirmatory data from placebo-controlled trials5 called into question the results of the PROWESS study and thus the efficacy of the drug.6\nDrotAA received marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of adults with severe sepsis and multiple organ failure, but the approval was subject to annual review.7 In 2007, the agency concluded that sufficient doubt existed to warrant a new placebo-controlled trial.8 We conducted the PROWESS-SHOCK study to test the hypothesis that DrotAA, as compared with placebo, would reduce mortality in patients with septic shock.9\nMethods\nStudy Patients\nThe study protocol has been published previously (www.springerlink.com/content/t3353213r20835ul/fulltext.pdf).9 The trial was approved by the institutional review board at each study center, and written informed consent was obtained from patients or their legally authorized surrogates in accordance with local requirements.\nAdult patients were eligible for inclusion if they had sepsis (infection and two or more signs of systemic inflammation), shock, and clinical evidence of hypoperfusion. We defined hypoperfusion as metabolic acidosis (base deficit, ≥5.0 mmol per liter; venous bicarbonate, <18 mmol per liter; or lactate, >2.5 mmol per liter) or renal or hepatic dysfunction. (Case definitions are provided in the protocol.) We defined shock as the need for treatment with norepinephrine at a dose of at least 5 μg per minute or an equivalent dose of another vasopressor for 4 hours or more, provided that at least 30 ml per kilogram of body weight of crystalloid or an equivalent volume of colloid was administered during the 8-hour interval surrounding the start of vasopressor treatment. We required that patients remain refractory to reasonable attempts to wean vasopressors and begin study treatment within 24 hours after the first dose of a vasopressor.
