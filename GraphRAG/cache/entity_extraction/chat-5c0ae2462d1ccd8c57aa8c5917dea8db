However, its effectiveness is uncertain.\nMethods\nIn this trial conducted at 51 centers (mostly in Australia or New Zealand), we randomly assigned patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock to receive either EGDT or usual care. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 90 days after randomization.\nResults\nOf the 1600 enrolled patients, 796 were assigned to the EGDT group and 804 to the usual-care group. Primary outcome data were available for more than 99% of the patients. Patients in the EGDT group received a larger mean (±SD) volume of intravenous fluids in the first 6 hours after randomization than did those in the usual-care group (1964±1415 ml vs. 1713±1401 ml) and were more likely to receive vasopressor infusions (66.6% vs. 57.8%), red-cell transfusions (13.6% vs. 7.0%), and dobutamine (15.4% vs. 2.6%) (P<0.001 for all comparisons). At 90 days after randomization, 147 deaths had occurred in the EGDT group and 150 had occurred in the usual-care group, for rates of death of 18.6% and 18.8%, respectively (absolute risk difference with EGDT vs. usual care, −0.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, −4.1 to 3.6; P=0.90). There was no significant difference in survival time, in-hospital mortality, duration of organ support, or length of hospital stay.\nConclusions\nIn critically ill patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock, EGDT did not reduce all-cause mortality at 90 days. (Funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and the Alfred Foundation; ARISE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975793.)\nSevere sepsis has a reported annual incidence in adults of up to 300 cases per 100,000 population.1–3 Despite decreasing mortality from sepsis in recent years,4 the risk of death remains high.5,6 The fundamental principles for the management of sepsis include early recognition, control of the source of infection, appropriate and timely administration of antimicrobial drugs, and resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasoactive drugs.\nPatients presenting to the emergency department account for a large proportion of patients with severe sepsis.7 Reported in-hospital mortality ranges in this subgroup from 20 to 50%.3,8–10 In 2001, a proof-of-concept, randomized trial showed that early hemodynamic resuscitation according to a specific protocol termed early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) improved outcomes in patients presenting to the emergency department with severe sepsis, as compared with usual therapy.11\nEGDT was subsequently incorporated into the 6-hour resuscitation bundle of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines,12–14 and a number of nonrandomized studies showed a survival benefit with bundle-based care that included EGDT.15–18 Despite such successes, considerable controversy has surrounded the role of EGDT in the treatment of patients with severe sepsis. Concerns have included the potential risks associated with individual elements of the protocol,19,20 uncertainty about the external validity of the original trial, and the infrastructure and resource requirements for implementing EGDT.21,22\nIn a randomized trial conducted in 31 academic centers in the United States (Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock [ProCESS]),10 protocol-based resuscitation (a combination of EGDT and protocol-based standard therapy) was not associated with a survival benefit, as compared with usual care that was not protocol-based. Whether these results would hold up outside the United States and across a variety of academic and nonacademic health care settings is unknown; more evidence is needed to provide clinical direction.23\nWe designed the multicenter Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE) study to test the hypothesis that EGDT, as compared with usual care, would decrease 90-day all-cause mortality among patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock in diverse health care settings.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Oversight\nFrom October 5, 2008, to April 23, 2014, we conducted this prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial in 51 tertiary care and nontertiary care metropolitan and rural hospitals. Most centers were in Australia or New Zealand, with 6 centers in Finland, Hong Kong, and the Republic of Ireland (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).24 Participating institutions did not have sepsis-resuscitation protocols at the time of site selection, and usual care did not include resuscitation guided by measurement of the central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2).25 The ARISE study was one of three collaborative, harmonized studies, along with the ProCESS trial10 and the Protocolized Management in Sepsis (ProMISe) trial (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN36307479), designed to address the effectiveness of EGDT.24\nThe study protocol was approved by the ethics committee at Monash University, which was the coordinating center, and at each participating institution. The protocol and statistical analysis plan are available at NEJM.org. Prior informed written consent or delayed consent was obtained from all patients or their legal surrogates. The trial was overseen by an independent data and safety monitoring committee.
