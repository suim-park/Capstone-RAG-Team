The distribution of ICU-free days according to study group is shown in Figure S7 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nTable 2\n\nStudy Outcomes.\nSecondary Outcomes\nThere were no significant differences between the acetaminophen group and the placebo group with respect to mortality at day 28 or at day 90 (Table 2, and Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix) or with respect to survival time to day 90 (Figure 2). A total of 55 of 345 patients (15.9%) assigned to acetaminophen and 57 of 344 patients (16.6%) assigned to placebo had died by 90 days (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.39; P=0.84).\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan–Meier Estimates of the Probability of Survival to Day 90.\nThere was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to ICU length of stay (4.1 days [interquartile range, 2.1 to 8.3] among patients assigned to acetaminophen and 4.2 days [interquartile range, 2.0 to 9.0] among patients assigned to placebo; absolute difference, −0.1 days; 95% CI, −0.7 to 0.4; P=0.65) or with respect to hospital length of stay (13.7 days [interquartile range, 7.6 to 22.9] among patients assigned to acetaminophen and 13.8 days [interquartile range, 7.1 to 24.3] among patients assigned to placebo; absolute difference, −0.01 days; 95% CI, −1.6 to 1.6; P=0.98). There was heterogeneity of response, with acetaminophen associated with a shorter median ICU length of stay than placebo among survivors (3.5 days [interquartile range, 1.9 to 6.9] vs. 4.3 days [interquartile range, 2.1 to 8.9], P=0.01) and with a longer median ICU length of stay among nonsurvivors (10.4 days [interquartile range, 4.1 to 16.9] vs. 4.0 days [interquartile range, 1.7 to 9.4], P<0.001) (P<0.001 for interaction) (Table 3).\nTable 3\n\nLogarithmic Transformation Analysis of ICU and Hospital Length of Stay among Survivors versus Nonsurvivors.\nThere were no significant differences between the study groups with respect to any other secondary outcome variables (Table 2). There was no significant heterogeneity in study-drug effect on ICU-free days in any of the prespecified subgroups (Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nAdverse Events\nLiver dysfunction led to discontinuation of the study drug in 28 of 347 patients (8.1%) assigned to acetaminophen and in 34 of 344 patients (9.9%) assigned to placebo (odds ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.16; P=0.40). There was a serious adverse event of markedly elevated body temperature associated with death in 1 patient assigned to placebo (see the Supplementary Appendix).\nDiscussion\nIn this binational, blinded, randomized, controlled trial, we observed that the early administration of acetaminophen for treatment of fever in adult ICU patients with probable infection resulted in neither more ICU-free days nor fewer ICU-free days than those observed with administration of placebo. Although acetaminophen was associated with a shorter ICU stay than placebo among survivors and a longer stay among nonsurvivors, there was no significant difference between the acetaminophen group and the placebo group with respect to 28-day mortality, 90-day mortality, or survival time to day 90. Patients who received intravenous acetaminophen had a lower body temperature than those who received placebo and did not have significantly more adverse events.\nData are lacking from previous blinded, randomized, controlled trials to evaluate the use of intravenous acetaminophen to treat fever in ICU patients with suspected infection. The magnitude of the temperature reduction observed in our study is consistent with that in studies involving patients with acute ischemic stroke21 and critically ill adults with fever and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome.22\nOur observation that ICU and hospital length of stay were longer with acetaminophen than with placebo among patients who died is consistent with the finding of a study in which physical cooling to normothermia delayed death in mechanically ventilated patients with septic shock.4 These observations are also consistent with a recent retrospective cohort study in which a Cox proportional-hazards analysis showed that ICU patients who received acetaminophen had a significantly longer time to death than those who did not.23\nWe sought to minimize ascertainment bias through centralized randomization, concealment of allocation to study groups, and masking of the study drugs. We used a primary outcome that is not subject to observer bias. To further minimize bias, we published the statistical analysis plan15 and conducted all analyses, including post hoc analyses, before unmasking the study-group assignments. Although our predominantly nonsurgical patient population had low mortality, illness-severity scores were higher than those observed in a recent trial involving patients with septic shock.24 Moreover, our results\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
