The same mechanical-ventilation strategies were used in both groups, including a strategy involving a high PEEP. The primary end point was in-hospital death from any cause at 90 days.\nResults\nThe trial was stopped at the second interim analysis for futility. We enrolled 1006 patients early after the onset of moderate-to-severe ARDS (median, 7.6 hours after onset). During the first 48 hours after randomization, 488 of the 501 patients (97.4%) in the intervention group started a continuous infusion of cisatracurium (median duration of infusion, 47.8 hours; median dose, 1807 mg), and 86 of the 505 patients (17.0%) in the control group received a neuromuscular blocking agent (median dose, 38 mg). At 90 days, 213 patients (42.5%) in the intervention group and 216 (42.8%) in the control group had died before hospital discharge (between-group difference, −0.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, −6.4 to 5.9; P=0.93). While in the hospital, patients in the intervention group were less physically active and had more adverse cardiovascular events than patients in the control group. There were no consistent between-group differences in end points assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months.\nConclusions\nAmong patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS who were treated with a strategy involving a high PEEP, there was no significant difference in mortality at 90 days between patients who received an early and continuous cisatracurium infusion and those who were treated with a usual-care approach with lighter sedation targets.

For example, neuromuscular blockade reduces patient–ventilator dyssynchrony, the work of breathing, and the accumulation of alveolar fluid; patients with ARDS could benefit from these outcomes.2 However, prolonged administration of neuromuscular blocking agents is associated with subsequent neuromuscular weakness.3,4 The largest multicenter trial to date (the ARDS et Curarisation Systematique [ACURASYS] trial)5 was conducted a decade ago, and ICU practices have changed since then. The investigators of that trial reported that the early administration of a 48-hour infusion of neuromuscular blockade in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen [Pao2] to the fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio2] of <150 mm Hg with a positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] of ≥5 cm of water) resulted in lower mortality than a strategy of deep sedation without routine neuromuscular blockade.5 Despite these encouraging results, early neuromuscular blockade is not widely adopted and is only weakly recommended in current guidelines.6-9 Potential concerns include the lack of research comparing neuromuscular blockade and deep sedation with current practice (which promotes lighter sedation targets8,10–12) as well as limited data on the effect of neuromuscular blockade on neuromuscular function and other long-term outcomes.2,13 In addition, neuromuscular blockade requires deep sedation, which itself can result in negative outcomes.6,12,14\nThe Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL) Clinical Trials Network of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) conducted the Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial — a multicenter, unblinded, randomized trial of patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS — to determine the efficacy and safety of early neuromuscular blockade with concomitant heavy sedation as compared with a strategy of usual care with lighter sedation targets. We hypothesized that the use of early neuromuscular blockade would result in lower all-cause in-hospital mortality at 90 days than usual care.\nMethods\nTrial Design and Oversight\nWe designed the ROSE trial to be consistent with certain elements of the ACURASYS trial.5,15 Similarities included the use of the same neuromuscular blocking agent (cisatracurium) with the same dosing regimen and duration of treatment. A key difference was our use of lighter sedation targets in the control group to be consistent with current practice recommendations.6,8,9 To minimize potentially confounding differences in the use of cointerventions, we specified the approach to mechanical ventilation in the protocol\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
