In most of the patients who had been randomly assigned to EGDT, a central venous catheter for monitoring of ScvO2 was placed promptly (Fig. S6A in the Supplementary Appendix). The reasons for failure to place a central venous catheter, which occurred in 30 of the 439 patients in that group (6.8%), included technical difficulties (10 patients), refusal by the treating clinician (9) or patient (5), the need for emergency surgery (1), and death (1); no reason was provided in the case of 4 patients). The mean (±SD) ScvO2 after catheterization was 71±13%. Although placement of central venous catheters was not required for patients in the protocol-based standard-therapy group or the usual-care group, central venous catheters were placed in 56.5% of the patients (252 patients) and 57.9% (264 patients) in the two groups, respectively; however, placement occurred later than in the EGDT group (P<0.001) (Fig. S6B in the Supplementary Appendix) and involved serial monitoring of ScvO2 in only a small proportion of patients (4.0% [18 patients] in the protocol-based standard-therapy group and 3.5% [16 patients] in the usual-care groups, vs. 93.6% [411 patients] in the EGDT group; P<0.001).\nResuscitation\nDuring the first 6 hours, the volume of intravenous fluids administered differed significantly among the groups (2.8 liters in the protocol-based EGDT group, 3.3 liters in the protocol-based standard-therapy group, and 2.3 liters in the usual-care group (P<0.001) (Table S4 and Fig. S6C in the Supplementary Appendix). The volume of fluids administered decreased during the 6 hours in all the groups, but patients in the protocol-based standard-therapy group received the greatest volume initially and overall, patients in the usual-care group received the least volume of fluid, and patients in the protocol-based EGDT group received fluid at the most consistent rate (P<0.001 for differences in total volume and P=0.007 for differences over time). Crystalloids were the predominant fluid used in all the groups, administered in 96% of the patients overall. More patients in the two protocol-based groups than in the usual-care group received vasopressors (54.9% in the protocol-based EGDT group and 52.2% in the protocol-based standard-therapy group vs. 44.1% in the usual-care group, P=0.003) (Table S4 and Fig. S6D in the Supplementary Appendix). More patients in the protocol-based EGDT group than in the protocol-based standard-therapy group or the usual-care group received dobutamine and packed red-cell transfusions (dobutamine use, 8.0% vs. 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively; P<0.001; packed red-cell transfusions, 14.4% vs. 8.3% and 7.5%, respectively; P=0.001) (Table S4, and Fig. S6D in the Supplementary Appendix). The use of antibiotics, glucocorticoids, and activated protein C was similar across the three groups (with P values ranging from 0.16 to 0.90) (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nAncillary Care\nThe use of intravenous fluids, vasopressors, dobutamine, and blood transfusions between 6 and 72 hours did not differ significantly among the groups (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients in all three groups had mean values that were consistent with low-tidal-volume ventilation and moderate glycemic control (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). In general, the condition of the patients in all three groups improved over time, with few differences among the groups. By 6 hours, the target mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or higher had been achieved in more patients in each of the protocol-based groups than in the usual-care group (P=0.02), but the mean heart rate did not differ significantly among the groups (P=0.32) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients in the protocol-based EGDT group had a higher mean international normalized ratio at 6 hours (2.2, vs. 1.7 in the protocol-based standard-therapy group and 1.6 in the usual-care group; P=0.01), whereas patients in the usual-care group had slightly less acidosis at 6 hours and 24 hours (arterial pH, 7.31 in each protocol-based group vs. 7.34 in the usual-care group at 6 hours, and 7.34 in each protocol-based group vs. 7.36 in the usual-care group at 24 hours, P=0.02), but these differences did not persist.\nOutcomes\nBy day 60, a total of 92 patients in the protocol-based EGDT group (21.0%), 81 in the protocol-based standard-therapy group (18.2%), and 86 in the usual-care group (18.9%) had died in the hospital (Table 2). The 60-day in-hospital mortality for the combined protocol-based groups (19.5% [173 of 885 patients]) did not differ significantly from that in the usual-care group (relative risk, 1.04\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EGDT GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The EGDT group is a protocol-based treatment group in a clinical study, focusing on early goal-directed therapy for patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STANDARD-THERAPY GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The standard-therapy group is a protocol-based treatment group in a clinical study, focusing on standard therapy for patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The usual-care group is a treatment group in a clinical study, focusing on usual care practices for patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESUSCITATION<|>EVENT<|>Resuscitation refers to the process of administering intravenous fluids and other treatments to stabilize patients in the study)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT GROUP<|>RESUSCITATION<|>The EGDT group received a specific protocol of resuscitation involving intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and other treatments<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STANDARD-THERAPY GROUP<|>RESUSCITATION<|>The standard-therapy group received a specific protocol of resuscitation involving intravenous fluids and other treatments<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>RESUSCITATION<|>The usual-care group received resuscitation involving intravenous fluids and other treatments<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT GROUP<|>STANDARD-THERAPY GROUP<|>Both groups are part of a clinical study comparing different treatment protocols<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT GROUP<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>Both groups are part of a clinical study comparing different treatment protocols<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STANDARD-THERAPY GROUP<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>Both groups are part of a clinical study comparing different treatment protocols<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
