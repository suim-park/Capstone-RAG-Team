The North West London Research Ethics Committee approved the study protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded the study and convened a trial steering committee and independent data monitoring and ethics committee. The Clinical Trials Unit at the United Kingdom Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) managed the study (for details, see the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). Edwards Lifesciences loaned monitors and provided training and technical support but had no other role in the study.\nSites and Patients\nThe study was conducted in English NHS hospitals that did not routinely use EGDT that included continuous ScvO2 monitoring. Adults (≥18 years of age) were eligible if within 6 hours after presentation to the emergency department they had a known or presumed infection, two or more criteria of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome,16 and either refractory hypotension (systolic blood pressure, <90 mm Hg; or mean arterial pressure, <65 mm Hg, despite resuscitation with at least 1 liter of intravenous fluids within 60 minutes) or hyperlactatemia (blood lactate level, ≥4 mmol per liter) and did not meet any exclusion criteria (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix).\nRandomization had to be completed within 2 hours after the patient met the inclusion criteria. All patients provided written informed consent, or consent was granted through an agreement with a personal or professional consultee or independent clinician.17 Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio by means of 24-hour telephone randomization to receive either EGDT or usual care. Study-group assignment was performed by means of randomized permuted blocks, with variable block lengths of 4, 6, and 8, and stratified according to site. In all study patients, antimicrobial drugs were initiated before randomization.\nStudy Interventions\nAfter randomization, the usual-care group continued to receive monitoring, investigations, and treatment as determined by the treating clinicians, whereas the EGDT group started the resuscitation protocol (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). For the latter, during the first hour, which was defined as the next whole hour (e.g., if randomization was performed at 9:24, then by 11 o'clock), a central venous catheter capable of continuous ScvO2 monitoring was placed. The resuscitation protocol was followed for 6 hours (intervention period) with personnel involved and treatment location decided according to the site. At least one trained staff member was available throughout the intervention period. Key staff members were trained before the initiation of recruitment at each site. All other treatment, during the intervention period and after, was at the discretion of the treating clinicians. Blinding to study-group assignment was not possible. During the intervention period, data were collected prospectively for the EGDT group and retrospectively for the usual-care group to avoid the influence of data collection on treatment delivery.\nOutcome Measures\nThe primary clinical outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were the score on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)18 at 6 hours and 72 hours; receipt of advanced cardiovascular, advanced respiratory, or renal support and the number of days in the first 28 days after randomization that were free from such support19; length of stay in the emergency department, intensive care unit (ICU), and hospital; duration of survival; all-cause mortality at 28 days, at hospital discharge, and at 1 year; and health-related quality of life (as measured on the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions [EQ-5D] five-level questionnaire), resource use, and costs at 90 days and 1 year. Adverse events were monitored up to 30 days. All definitions are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\nStatistical Analysis\nUsing the ICNARC Case Mix Program Database,20 we estimated that 90-day mortality would be 40% in the usual-care group. On the basis of this estimation, we calculated that an enrollment of 1260 patients would have a power of 80% to detect a relative reduction of 20% in risk (absolute risk reduction, 8 percentage points) in the EGDT group, allowing for a loss to follow-up or withdrawal of 6%.21\nAll analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle and were prespecified in the statistical analysis plan.22 A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All tests were two-sided with no adjustment for multiple comparisons. Continuous variables are reported as means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges. Categorical variables are reported as proportions.\nWe used Fisher's exact test to compare between-group differences in the primary outcome. Relative and absolute reductions in risk are reported with 95% confidence intervals without adjustment. Secondary analyses of the primary outcome included odds ratio with adjustment for Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS) score components, sensitivity analyses for missing data, learning-curve analysis, and adherence-adjusted analysis. We conducted prespecified subgroup analyses by testing interactions between the effect of EGDT and the degree of protocolized care (in the usual-care group), age, MEDS score,23 SOFA score, and the time from presentation at the emergency department to randomization.\nIn the cost-effectiveness analysis, we reported quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by combining survival data with quality-of-life scores at 90 days and estimated incremental net benefits by valuing incremental QALYs at the recommended threshold for a QALY gain (£20,000 [U.S. $28,430]) and then subtracting the incremental costs from this value.24 Stata/SE software, version 13.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NORTH WEST LONDON RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The North West London Research Ethics Committee is responsible for approving the study protocol for the trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED KINGDOM NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH RESEARCH (NIHR)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The NIHR funded the study and convened a trial steering committee and independent data monitoring and ethics committee)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLINICAL TRIALS UNIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Clinical Trials Unit at the United Kingdom Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre managed the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Edwards Lifesciences loaned monitors and provided training and technical support for the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENGLISH NHS HOSPITALS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The study was conducted in English NHS hospitals that did not routinely use EGDT with continuous ScvO2 monitoring)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGDT<|>EVENT<|>EGDT refers to Early Goal-Directed Therapy, a resuscitation protocol used in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEQUENTIAL ORGAN FAILURE ASSESSMENT (SOFA)<|>EVENT<|>The SOFA score was used as a secondary outcome measure in the study to assess organ failure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN QUALITY OF LIFE–5 DIMENSIONS (EQ-5D)<|>EVENT<|>The EQ-5D five-level questionnaire was used to measure health-related quality of life in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICNARC CASE MIX PROGRAM DATABASE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The ICNARC Case Mix Program Database was used to estimate 90-day mortality rates for the study)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH WEST LONDON RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE<|>UNITED KINGDOM NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH RESEARCH (NIHR)<|>The North West London Research Ethics Committee approved the study protocol funded by the NIHR<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED KINGDOM NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH RESEARCH (NIHR)<|>CLINICAL TRIALS UNIT<|>The NIHR funded the study managed by the Clinical Trials Unit<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES<|>CLINICAL TRIALS UNIT<|>Edwards Lifesciences provided equipment and support for the study managed by the Clinical Trials Unit<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENGLISH NHS HOSPITALS<|>EGDT<|>The study was conducted in English NHS hospitals using the EGDT protocol<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT<|>SEQUENTIAL ORGAN FAILURE ASSESSMENT (SOFA)<|>The SOFA score was used to assess outcomes in patients receiving EGDT<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT<|>EUROPEAN QUALITY OF LIFE–5 DIMENSIONS (EQ-5D)<|>The EQ-5D was used to measure quality of life in patients receiving EGDT<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ICNARC CASE MIX PROGRAM DATABASE<|>EGDT<|>The ICNARC Case Mix Program Database was used to estimate mortality rates for patients receiving EGDT<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
