Although the overall rate of death in the usual-care group was lower than anticipated (29% rather than 40%), it is unlikely that patients in the EGDT group would have a relative reduction of more than 15% in risk. The effect of EGDT was not significantly different in prespecified subgroups. More patients receiving EGDT were admitted to and spent more days in the ICU. Treatment intensity was greater in the EGDT group, driven by adherence to the protocol and indicated by the increased use of central venous catheters, intravenous fluids, vasoactive drugs, and red-cell transfusions. Increased intensity was reflected by significantly higher SOFA scores and more days of receiving advanced cardiovascular support. There were no significant differences in any other secondary outcomes, including health-related quality of life, which was substantially poorer in this severely ill group of patients (0.60) than in the general population matched for age and sex (0.80).25 On average, the use of EGDT increased costs, and given similar QALYs in the two groups, the probability that EGDT was cost-effective was below 20%.\nOur study was set in a real-world context and in a large, representative, mixed sample of approximately one quarter of NHS hospitals in England. Site setup was rapid, and the study recruited the full 1260 patients over a shorter time period than those of the two similar studies in the United States12 and Australasia.13 This factor minimized the potential for other changes in clinical practice to affect outcomes. Unlike previous studies, our study reports on quality of life and cost-effectiveness at 90 days. Loss to follow-up was low, and all analyses were conducted according to a prespecified statistical analysis plan and included adjusted analyses to address the degree of adherence to EGDT and the possibility of the existence of a learning curve for its delivery.\nOur study has several limitations. As in all studies that enroll patients presenting to emergency departments, recruitment was more challenging on weekends and during out-of-office hours; overall, only one third of eligible patients were recruited, although exclusion from the study by a clinician was rare. The intervention could not be blinded, but the risk of bias was minimized through central randomization to ensure the concealment of study-group assignments and the use of a primary outcome that was not subject to observer bias. Since the rate of death was lower than anticipated, our study data may not apply to settings with higher mortality.\nUnlike Rivers et al., in their 2001 study, we did not observe a significant reduction in hospital mortality with the use of EGDT. Many aspects of initial sepsis management have changed during the past 15 years, as can be seen in comparing the usual-care groups. In our study, as compared with the study by Rivers et al., mortality was substantially reduced, randomization occurred later, patients appeared to be less sick at baseline (with lower blood lactate levels and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II scores), and all patients received antibiotics before randomization. In addition, our patients received much lower volumes of intravenous fluids and more vasoactive drugs (Table S20 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nThe level of adherence to EGDT was good and was equivalent to adherence levels in the ProCESS12 and ARISE13 trials and higher than reported rates of compliance with the SSC guidelines.26 Most outcomes were similar to those reported in the ProCESS and ARISE trials, although the rate of death at 90 days that was reported in our study was lower than that in the ProCESS trial but higher than that in the ARISE trial. Of note, a higher proportion of patients in our study than in the ProCESS and ARISE trials met both of the two inclusion criteria — refractory hypotension and hyperlactatemia (Table S21 in the Supplementary Appendix) — a factor that is associated in our national ICU database with a doubling of hospital mortality (Table S22 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that techniques used in usual resuscitation have evolved over the 15 years since the landmark study by Rivers et al.9 In our study, NHS hospitals achieved levels of in-hospital survival in patients receiving usual care that were similar to those achieved with EGDT in the earlier study for patients with septic shock who were identified early and received intravenous antibiotics and adequate fluid resuscitation. The addition of continuous ScvO2 monitoring and strict protocolization did not improve outcomes in the EGDT group. Our results complete the planned trio of studies of EGDT, all of which showed that EGDT was not superior to usual care.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EGDT<|>EVENT<|>Early Goal-Directed Therapy (EGDT) is a treatment protocol for managing septic shock, involving intensive monitoring and interventions such as central venous catheters, intravenous fluids, vasoactive drugs, and red-cell transfusions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NHS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly funded healthcare system of England, where the study was conducted)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENGLAND<|>GEO<|>Country where the study involving septic shock patients was conducted in NHS hospitals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIVERS ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Rivers et al. refers to the group of researchers who conducted a landmark study in 2001 on EGDT for septic shock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROCESS<|>EVENT<|>The ProCESS trial is a study that evaluated the effectiveness of EGDT in managing septic shock, similar to the study described in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARISE<|>EVENT<|>The ARISE trial is another study that assessed the impact of EGDT on septic shock, conducted in Australasia)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT<|>NHS<|>The study on EGDT was conducted in NHS hospitals in England<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT<|>RIVERS ET AL.<|>The study compared its findings on EGDT with those of the 2001 study by Rivers et al.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT<|>PROCESS<|>The study's findings on EGDT were compared with those of the ProCESS trial<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT<|>ARISE<|>The study's findings on EGDT were compared with those of the ARISE trial<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NHS<|>ENGLAND<|>The NHS is the healthcare system in England where the study was conducted<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
