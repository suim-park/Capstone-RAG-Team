We required that patients remain refractory to reasonable attempts to wean vasopressors and begin study treatment within 24 hours after the first dose of a vasopressor. (Full details regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.)\nPatients with coexisting illnesses with a high risk of death (e.g., metastatic cancer) were excluded. The clinical coordinating center confirmed the eligibility of each patient before randomization.\nStudy Treatments\nA centralized system randomly assigned patients to receive an intravenous infusion of DrotAA (Xigris, Eli Lilly) at a dose of 24 μg per kilogram of body weight per hour for 96 hours or matching placebo dissolved in 0.9% saline solution. Study-group assignments were concealed from patients, investigators, treating clinicians, and the sponsor. Temporary interruptions of the study infusion were mandated for invasive procedures; in such cases, the infusion was extended through day 6 (the treatment period) so that the 96-hour infusion could be completed wherever possible. All other treatments were at the discretion of treating clinicians.\nEvaluation of Patients\nWe assessed baseline demographic characteristics, preexisting conditions, organ function, sites of infection, microbiology results, and hematologic and laboratory measurements within 24 hours before the administration of a study drug. Blood samples for the measurement of protein C levels were collected on days 1 through 7. Assays to assess protein C activity were performed on an STA Compact coagulation analyzer with the use of the STA-Staclot protein C kit (Diagnostica Stago). Patients were followed until either 90 days or death.\nPrimary and Secondary Outcomes\nThe primary outcome was death at 28 days. Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality in patients with severe protein C deficiency (plasma concentration, ≤50% of the lower limit of the normal range), 90-day mortality, measures of organ dysfunction, and safety. We examined heterogeneity of the treatment effect on mortality at 28 and 90 days in prespecified subgroups, as defined by the following baseline characteristics: APACHE II score (<25 or ≥25), number of organs that had failed, presence or absence of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the quartile of time from the onset of shock to the initiation of study treatment, plasma protein C level, glucocorticoid treatment, prophylactic heparin administration, recent surgery, and platelet count.\nWe assessed organ function using Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores (on a scale of 0 to 4 for each organ system, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction). We used the SOFA score to measure the change from baseline to study day 7, using the mean arterial pressure and vasopressor dose to measure cardiovascular function, the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to the fraction of inspired oxygen to measure respiratory function, and the serum creatinine level to measure renal function.\nStudy Oversight\nThe steering committee designed the study in collaboration with the sponsor, Eli Lilly, as reported previously.9 Coauthors from the Duke Clinical Research Institute performed the analysis. The steering committee wrote the first draft of the manuscript, and the two first coauthors made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. All authors had full and independent access to all the data and vouch for the integrity, accuracy, and completeness of the analysis and its fidelity to the study protocol.10\nStatistical Analysis\nWe determined that the planned enrollment of 1500 patients would provide a power of 80% at a significance level of 0.05 to detect an absolute difference of 7 percentage points (20% relative risk reduction) in the primary outcome of 28-day mortality from the placebo rate of 35%. An independent data and safety monitoring board conducted interim analyses, as described previously.9 The protocol specified an increase in sample size if the 28-day mortality for 750 patients was less than 30%.\nThe final primary analysis used a P value of less than 0.05 with adjustment for interim analyses of the cumulative data. The 28-day primary efficacy analysis was conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle and documented in the statistical analysis plan, as described previously.9–11 Patients with unknown survival status at 28 days or 90 days were excluded from the landmark analyses. In the time-to-event analyses, data for patients with unknown survival status were censored on the last day that patients were known to be alive.\nWe used a Cox proportional-hazards model to estimate the hazard ratio for death with the use of DrotAA versus placebo. We used a log-rank test to assess differences in survival curves between the two groups in the time-to-event analysis through 28 days and 90 days. Survival estimates were calculated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method. We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to assess between-group differences in SOFA scores. Similarly, we used ranked analysis of variance to assess the change in protein C level from baseline to day 7 and to compare the two study groups. We used the Breslow–Day test for homogeneity of odds ratios to determine differences in the treatment effect across categories for each of the prespecified subgroups at 28 days. All safety analyses were conducted in the population of treated patients.\nResults\nStudy Patients\nAggregate mortality after recruitment of 750 patients was 27.6%. Therefore, we increased the sample size to 1696 on May 12, 2010. Patients were enrolled from March 2008 through August 2011 at 208 sites in Europe, North and South America,\n######################\nOutput:"

Thus, a replacement therapy of low doses of corticosteroids has been proposed to treat septic shock.\n\nObjective To assess whether low doses of corticosteroids improve 28-day survival in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency.\n\nDesign and Setting Placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial performed in 19 intensive care units in France from October 9, 1995, to February 23, 1999.\n\nPatients Three hundred adult patients who fulfilled usual criteria for septic shock were enrolled after undergoing a short corticotropin test.\n\nIntervention Patients were randomly assigned to receive either hydrocortisone (50-mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours) and fludrocortisone (50-µg tablet once daily) (n = 151) or matching placebos (n = 149) for 7 days.\n\nMain Outcome Measure Twenty-eight-day survival distribution in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency (nonresponders to the corticotropin test).\n\nResults One patient from the corticosteroid group was excluded from analyses because of consent withdrawal. There were 229 nonresponders to the corticotropin test (placebo, 115; corticosteroids, 114) and 70 responders to the corticotropin test (placebo, 34; corticosteroids, 36). In nonresponders, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.95; P = .02). Vasopressor therapy was withdrawn within 28 days in 46 patients (40%) in the placebo group and in 65 patients (57%) in the corticosteroid group (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-2.84; P = .001). There was no significant difference between groups in responders. Adverse events rates were similar in the 2 groups.\n\nConclusion In our trial, a 7-day treatment with low doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone significantly reduced the risk of death in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency without increasing adverse events.\n\nSevere sepsis remains an important cause of death, accounting for 9.3% of all deaths in the United States in 1995.1 If our understanding of the mechanisms of host response to stress has strongly progressed during the last 2 decades,2 the various drugs developed for specific targets of the cytokine cascade have failed to improve patient survival.3,4\n\nCorticosteroids were the first anti-inflammatory drugs tested in randomized trials. At high doses during short courses, they did not induce favorable effects.5,6 However, the observation that severe sepsis may be associated with relative adrenal insufficiency7,8 or systemic inflammation-induced glucocorticoid receptor resistance9 prompted renewed interest of a replacement therapy with low doses of corticosteroids during longer periods.10,11\n\nThe interest of this new approach was confirmed by the demonstration that a single intravenous administration of 50 mg of hydrocortisone strongly improved norepinephrine and phenylephrine mean arterial pressure dose-response relationships in patients with septic shock,12,13 particularly in those with relative adrenal insufficiency.12 Moreover, 2 small placebo-controlled randomized trials also showed that prolonged treatment (≥5 days) with low doses of hydrocortisone (about 300 mg daily) significantly improved the time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal in septic shock.14,15 Thus, we designed this placebo-controlled study to assess whether a replacement therapy with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone (assuming the possibility of a primary adrenal insufficiency)16 could improve 28-day survival in patients with septic shock, with particular interest in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency.\n\nMethods\nExperimental Design and Study Organization\nThis placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study was performed on 2 parallel groups at 19 intensive care units (ICUs) in France (Figure 1). It was supported by Groupe d'Etude et de Recherche sur le Médicament (GERMED), which awarded a grant from publicly funded resources. The protocol was approved by the Comité Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biomédicale of Saint-Germain en Laye, France, on February 9, 1995. Inclusions were authorized from September 11, 1995. Two interim analyses were planned. An independent main end point and safety monitoring board met after each interim analysis to decide whether the study should be continued or stopped. Enrollment ended March 15, 1999. At the end of the study, an independent diagnosis validation committee blindly classified each patient as being unquestionable, probable, or nonprobable for having had septic shock.\n\nPatients\nAll patients 18 years or older and hospitalized in participating ICUs were prospectively enrolled in the study if they met all the following criteria: (1) documented site (or at least strong suspicion) of infection, as evidenced by one or more of the following: presence of polymorphs in a normally sterile body fluid (except blood), positive culture or Gram stain of a normally sterile body fluid, clinical focus of infection (eg, fecal peritonitis), wound with purulent discharge, pneumonia or other clinical evidence of systemic infection (eg, purpura fulminans); (2) temperature higher than 38.3°C or lower than 35.6°C; (3) heart rate greater than\n######################\nOutput:"

        "text": "Abstract\nContext Septic shock may be associated with relative adrenal insufficiency. Thus, a replacement therapy of low doses of corticosteroids has been proposed to treat septic shock.\n\nObjective To assess whether low doses of corticosteroids improve 28-day survival in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency.\n\nDesign and Setting Placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial performed in 19 intensive care units in France from October 9, 1995, to February 23, 1999.\n\nPatients Three hundred adult patients who fulfilled usual criteria for septic shock were enrolled after undergoing a short corticotropin test.\n\nIntervention Patients were randomly assigned to receive either hydrocortisone (50-mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours) and fludrocortisone (50-µg tablet once daily) (n = 151) or matching placebos (n = 149) for 7 days.\n\nMain Outcome Measure Twenty-eight-day survival distribution in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency (nonresponders to the corticotropin test).\n\nResults One patient from the corticosteroid group was excluded from analyses because of consent withdrawal. There were 229 nonresponders to the corticotropin test (placebo, 115; corticosteroids, 114) and 70 responders to the corticotropin test (placebo, 34; corticosteroids, 36). In nonresponders, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.95; P = .02). Vasopressor therapy was withdrawn within 28 days in 46 patients (40%) in the placebo group and in 65 patients (57%) in the corticosteroid group (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-2.84; P = .001). There was no significant difference between groups in responders. Adverse events rates were similar in the 2 groups.\n\nConclusion In our trial, a 7-day treatment with low doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone significantly reduced the risk of death in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency without increasing adverse events.\n\nSevere sepsis remains an important cause of death, accounting for 9.3% of all deaths in the United States in 1995.1 If our understanding of the mechanisms of host response to stress has strongly progressed during the last 2 decades,2 the various drugs developed for specific targets of the cytokine cascade have failed to improve patient survival.3,4\n\nCorticosteroids were the first anti-inflammatory drugs tested in randomized trials. At high doses during short courses, they did not induce favorable effects.5,6 However, the observation that severe sepsis may be associated with relative adrenal insufficiency7,8 or systemic inflammation-induced glucocorticoid receptor resistance9 prompted renewed interest of a replacement therapy with low doses of corticosteroids during longer periods.10,11\n\nThe interest of this new approach was confirmed by the demonstration that a single intravenous administration of 50 mg of hydrocortisone strongly improved norepinephrine and phenylephrine mean arterial pressure dose-response relationships in patients with septic shock,12,13 particularly in those with relative adrenal insufficiency.12 Moreover, 2 small placebo-controlled randomized trials also showed that prolonged treatment (≥5 days) with low doses of hydrocortisone (about 300 mg daily) significantly improved the time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal in septic shock.14,15 Thus, we designed this placebo-controlled study to assess whether a replacement therapy with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone (assuming the possibility of a primary adrenal insufficiency)16 could improve 28-day survival in patients with septic shock, with particular interest in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency.\n\nMethods\nExperimental Design and Study Organization\nThis placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study was performed on 2 parallel groups at 19 intensive care units (ICUs) in France (Figure 1). It was supported by Groupe d'Etude et de Recherche sur le Médicament (GERMED), which awarded a grant from publicly funded resources. The protocol was approved by the Comité Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biomédicale of Saint-Germain en Laye, France, on February 9, 1995. Inclusions were authorized from September 11, 1995. Two interim analyses were planned. An independent main end point and safety monitoring board met after each interim analysis to decide whether the study should be continued or stopped. Enrollment ended March 15, 1999. At the end of the study, an independent diagnosis validation committee blindly classified each patient as being unquestionable, probable, or nonprobable for having had septic shock.\n\nPatients\nAll patients 18 years or older and hospitalized in participating ICUs were prospectively enrolled in the study if they met all the following criteria: (1) documented site (or at least strong suspicion) of infection, as evidenced by one or more of the following: presence of polymorphs in a normally sterile body fluid (except blood), positive culture or Gram stain of a normally sterile body fluid, clinical focus of infection (eg, fecal peritonitis), wound with purulent discharge, pneumonia or other clinical evidence of systemic infection (eg, purpura fulminans); (2) temperature higher than 38.3°C or lower than 35.6°C; (3) heart rate greater than"

Protein C activity increased from baseline during the first 6 days in both groups; the mean increase was significantly greater in patients in the DrotAA group than in the placebo group on each of the first 4 study days (P<0.001) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nProbability of Survival and Odds Ratios for Death, According to Subgroup.\nTable 2\n\nStudy Outcomes and Adverse Events.\nDuring the first 28 days, one or more serious adverse events were recorded in 119 of 833 patients (14.3%) in the DrotAA group versus 96 of 833 patients (11.5%) in the placebo group (P=0.10) (Table 2, and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). During the treatment period, nonserious bleeding events were more common among patients receiving DrotAA than among those receiving placebo (in 72 of 833 patients [8.6%] vs. 40 of 833 [4.8%], P=0.002), as were serious bleeding events (in 10 of 833 patients [1.2%] vs. 8 of 833 [1.0%], P=0.81), although the latter difference was not significant.\nDiscussion\nIn this large international study involving critically ill adults with septic shock, DrotAA did not reduce mortality at either 28 or 90 days, as compared with placebo. The lack of benefit was consistent across predefined subgroups.\nThe strengths of the trial lie in both its design and its execution. From the results of previous randomized trials, we identified a clinically relevant population of patients who were likely to benefit from treatment with DrotAA, and we predefined a limited number of relevant subgroups within this population.1,3,12–18 The characteristics of the patients we recruited matched the population we targeted. The baseline characteristics indicated a high degree of disease severity: 97.5% had multiple organ dysfunction, 90.2% had metabolic acidosis, and more than half had an elevated lactate level that persisted after fluid resuscitation. The baseline protein C level was markedly reduced in many patients. All patients remained dependent on vasopressors at study entry; most were treated with norepinephrine, with a median dose of 21 to 24 μg per minute at the start of study treatment. The baseline APACHE II score (which was designed to estimate the risk of death among critically ill patients rather than to assess the eligibility of individual patients for particular treatments) was somewhat lower than expected. Similar APACHE II scores have been reported in a trial of treatments for septic shock,19 and such scores may reflect improved early resuscitation, since they are sensitive to lead-time bias.20,21\nWe used an adaptive design22 that allowed us to increase the sample size to maintain adequate statistical power, since some trials involving patients with severe sepsis showed lower-than-expected mortality.19,23,24 To reduce the risk of assignment bias, we concealed study-group assignments before and after randomization, and to minimize crossovers, we used a standardized process to select hospitals and intensive care units that did not regularly treat patients with DrotAA. The success of these processes is evident in the excellent compliance with study treatment and the minimal crossover observed in the study. We achieved near complete follow-up and followed a predefined, published statistical analysis plan. We used mortality as an outcome that is less subject to biased ascertainment than other outcomes.25 We focused on mortality at 90 days,18 since 45% of the patients were still hospitalized at 28 days, a percentage similar to that reported in the PROWESS study.\nOur trial also has some limitations. We did not collect comprehensive data to study the coagulation or inflammatory responses during infusion of the study drugs, although such data exist from previous trials.1,3,12,13,17,26 The between-group difference in protein C activity in our trial was similar to that seen in the PROWESS study,27,28 and this finding combined with the expected increase in nonserious bleeding events in the DrotAA group5,13 indicates that the patients received the intended treatment; both are indirect markers of the biologic activity of DrotAA. Mortality in the placebo group was low, as compared with historical data,1,29–31 but consistent with that observed in more recent observational studies32,33 and trials.34,35\nOur findings are consistent with results of the Administration of Drotrecogin Alfa (Activated) in Early Stage Severe Sepsis (ADDRESS) and the Resolution of Organ Failure in Pediatric Patients with Severe Sepsis (RESOLVE) trials, which showed that DrotAA did not reduce mortality in children or adults with severe sepsis who had a low risk of death.3,4 Our results are consistent with the finding in the ADDRESS trial in that DrotAA was not effective in patients with an increased disease severity.4 We cannot explain the inconsistency between our findings and the reduction in mortality at 28 days that was observed in the PROWESS study.1 Our findings of similar mortality at 90 days are consistent with those of the PROWESS study at 3 months, at which time mortality was not significantly reduced by DrotAA.36\nOur study showed that DrotAA was not beneficial when administered to a population of patients for which it was an approved treatment. The fact that we found no benefit in any of the prespecified subgroups should reassure clinicians who no longer have DrotAA available to treat patients with septic shock.\n######################\nOutput:"

        "text": "-day study period did not differ significantly in the two groups (Table 2). Protein C activity increased from baseline during the first 6 days in both groups; the mean increase was significantly greater in patients in the DrotAA group than in the placebo group on each of the first 4 study days (P<0.001) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nProbability of Survival and Odds Ratios for Death, According to Subgroup.\nTable 2\n\nStudy Outcomes and Adverse Events.\nDuring the first 28 days, one or more serious adverse events were recorded in 119 of 833 patients (14.3%) in the DrotAA group versus 96 of 833 patients (11.5%) in the placebo group (P=0.10) (Table 2, and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). During the treatment period, nonserious bleeding events were more common among patients receiving DrotAA than among those receiving placebo (in 72 of 833 patients [8.6%] vs. 40 of 833 [4.8%], P=0.002), as were serious bleeding events (in 10 of 833 patients [1.2%] vs. 8 of 833 [1.0%], P=0.81), although the latter difference was not significant.\nDiscussion\nIn this large international study involving critically ill adults with septic shock, DrotAA did not reduce mortality at either 28 or 90 days, as compared with placebo. The lack of benefit was consistent across predefined subgroups.\nThe strengths of the trial lie in both its design and its execution. From the results of previous randomized trials, we identified a clinically relevant population of patients who were likely to benefit from treatment with DrotAA, and we predefined a limited number of relevant subgroups within this population.1,3,12–18 The characteristics of the patients we recruited matched the population we targeted. The baseline characteristics indicated a high degree of disease severity: 97.5% had multiple organ dysfunction, 90.2% had metabolic acidosis, and more than half had an elevated lactate level that persisted after fluid resuscitation. The baseline protein C level was markedly reduced in many patients. All patients remained dependent on vasopressors at study entry; most were treated with norepinephrine, with a median dose of 21 to 24 μg per minute at the start of study treatment. The baseline APACHE II score (which was designed to estimate the risk of death among critically ill patients rather than to assess the eligibility of individual patients for particular treatments) was somewhat lower than expected. Similar APACHE II scores have been reported in a trial of treatments for septic shock,19 and such scores may reflect improved early resuscitation, since they are sensitive to lead-time bias.20,21\nWe used an adaptive design22 that allowed us to increase the sample size to maintain adequate statistical power, since some trials involving patients with severe sepsis showed lower-than-expected mortality.19,23,24 To reduce the risk of assignment bias, we concealed study-group assignments before and after randomization, and to minimize crossovers, we used a standardized process to select hospitals and intensive care units that did not regularly treat patients with DrotAA. The success of these processes is evident in the excellent compliance with study treatment and the minimal crossover observed in the study. We achieved near complete follow-up and followed a predefined, published statistical analysis plan. We used mortality as an outcome that is less subject to biased ascertainment than other outcomes.25 We focused on mortality at 90 days,18 since 45% of the patients were still hospitalized at 28 days, a percentage similar to that reported in the PROWESS study.\nOur trial also has some limitations. We did not collect comprehensive data to study the coagulation or inflammatory responses during infusion of the study drugs, although such data exist from previous trials.1,3,12,13,17,26 The between-group difference in protein C activity in our trial was similar to that seen in the PROWESS study,27,28 and this finding combined with the expected increase in nonserious bleeding events in the DrotAA group5,13 indicates that the patients received the intended treatment; both are indirect markers of the biologic activity of DrotAA. Mortality in the placebo group was low, as compared with historical data,1,29–31 but consistent with that observed in more recent observational studies32,33 and trials.34,35\nOur findings are consistent with results of the Administration of Drotrecogin Alfa (Activated) in Early Stage Severe Sepsis (ADDRESS) and the Resolution of Organ Failure in Pediatric Patients with Severe Sepsis (RESOLVE) trials, which showed that DrotAA did not reduce mortality in children or adults with severe sepsis who had a low risk of death.3,4 Our results are consistent with the finding in the ADDRESS trial in that DrotAA was not effective in patients with an increased disease severity.4 We cannot explain the inconsistency between our findings and the reduction in mortality at 28 days that was observed in the PROWESS study.1 Our findings of similar mortality at 90 days are consistent with those of the PROWESS study at 3 months, at which time mortality was not significantly reduced by DrotAA.36\nOur study showed that DrotAA was not beneficial when administered to a population of patients for which it was an approved treatment. The fact that we found no benefit in any of the prespecified subgroups should reassure clinicians who no longer have DrotAA available to treat patients with septic shock."

28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates; and time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal during the 28 days from randomization in the 2 subsets of patients and in all patients.\n\nAdverse events were carefully monitored and classified as being possibly related to corticosteroids (superinfection, gastrointestinal bleeding, psychiatric disorders), possibly related to vasopressors (life-threatening arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, limb or cerebral ischemia), related to ICU invasive procedures, and not related to 1 of the 3 previous categories.\n\nSample Size and Statistical Analysis\nA total of 270 patients was the calculated sample size needed to detect, in a 1-sided test performed with a 0.05 type I error, a difference between the 2 groups of nonresponders on the 28-day mortality rate of 20% with a 90% probability, assuming a mortality rate of 95% in the nonresponder placebo subgroup7,22 and a frequency of nonresponders of 40% in the population of patients with septic shock.7 A 1-sided formulation was chosen to compute the sample size because the trial was designed to test whether low doses of corticosteroids were more effective than placebo, and we had no interest in formally demonstrating the opposite alternative hypothesis (a deleterious effect of corticosteroids).22,23\n\nThe 2 interim analyses were planned using an O'Brien and Fleming stopping boundary.24 With this procedure, the differences between the 2 groups were considered significant if the critical z values were higher than 3.471, 2.454, and 2.004 at the first, second, and final analyses, respectively (corresponding to nominal 2-sided P values <.0005, <.0141 and <.0451, respectively).\n\nThe statistical analysis, prospectively defined, was performed according to the intent-to-treat principle (in all analyses, patients were grouped according to their original randomized treatment) with SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For continuous variables, the mean (SDs) are reported whereas, for categorical variables, the number of patients in each category and the corresponding percentages are given.\n\nAnalyses were similarly performed in nonresponders, in responders, and in all patients. Pretreatment characteristics were compared between groups using the t test (for continuous variables) or χ2 or Fisher exact tests when appropriate (for categorical variables). Cumulative event curves (28-day survival and time-to-vasopressor therapy withdrawal end points) were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier procedure and median times to event were reported. The effects of treatments on these end points were estimated from adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models25 using baseline cortisol, cortisol response, McCabe classification, LOD score, arterial lactate levels, and PaO2/FIO2 results for the adjustment.8 Corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Proportionality among the event rates in the Cox models was assessed by the plot of the log (−log [survival function]) vs time. When the proportionality assumption was not upheld, Cox models were not used and only the Kaplan-Meier curves were reported along with log-rank tests. For 28-day survival, patients who were still alive at 28 days were treated as censored. For this end point, the number needed to treat at 28 days was estimated.26 For time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal, among patients who had more than 1 outcome event during the 28 days from randomization, time to the first event was used in the analyses. For this end point, the patients who died before vasopressor therapy could be withdrawn and those for whom vasopressor therapy could not be withdrawn during the 28 days from randomization were treated as censored. The effects of treatments on the frequency of fatal events (28-day, ICU, hospital and 1-year mortality rates) were estimated from logistic regression analysis using the same variables for the adjustment as the Cox models. Corresponding adjusted odds ratios (ORs) along with their 95% CIs were reported. We also computed the 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year relative risks (RRs) of death along with their 95% CIs. The frequency of adverse events was compared between groups using the χ2 or Fisher exact tests when appropriate. All reported P values are 2-sided.\n\nResults\nStudy Description\nFrom October 9, 1995, to February 23, 1999, 1326 patients were screened and 300 patients (placebo, 149; corticosteroids, 151) were included in the study (Figure 1). Interim analyses were performed on April 3, 1997, and April 20, 1998, after the evaluation of 114 and 220 patients, respectively. After each analysis, the independent main end point and safety monitoring board advised the study chairpersons to continue the study. We included the patient in the placebo group who died before study drugs could be administered in our intent-to-treat analysis. One patient in the corticosteroid group was excluded from the final analysis because of consent withdrawal. Among the 299 remaining patients, there were 229 nonresponders (placebo, 115; corticosteroids, 114) and 70 responders (placebo, 34; corticosteroids, 36).\n\nCharacteristics of Study Patients at Inclusion\nAt baseline, the 2 groups were balanced with respect to general characteristics (Table 1) and severity of illness (Table 2).

For continuous variables, the mean (SDs) are reported whereas, for categorical variables, the number of patients in each category and the corresponding percentages are given.\n\nAnalyses were similarly performed in nonresponders, in responders, and in all patients. Pretreatment characteristics were compared between groups using the t test (for continuous variables) or χ2 or Fisher exact tests when appropriate (for categorical variables). Cumulative event curves (28-day survival and time-to-vasopressor therapy withdrawal end points) were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier procedure and median times to event were reported. The effects of treatments on these end points were estimated from adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models25 using baseline cortisol, cortisol response, McCabe classification, LOD score, arterial lactate levels, and PaO2/FIO2 results for the adjustment.8 Corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Proportionality among the event rates in the Cox models was assessed by the plot of the log (−log [survival function]) vs time. When the proportionality assumption was not upheld, Cox models were not used and only the Kaplan-Meier curves were reported along with log-rank tests. For 28-day survival, patients who were still alive at 28 days were treated as censored. For this end point, the number needed to treat at 28 days was estimated.26 For time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal, among patients who had more than 1 outcome event during the 28 days from randomization, time to the first event was used in the analyses. For this end point, the patients who died before vasopressor therapy could be withdrawn and those for whom vasopressor therapy could not be withdrawn during the 28 days from randomization were treated as censored. The effects of treatments on the frequency of fatal events (28-day, ICU, hospital and 1-year mortality rates) were estimated from logistic regression analysis using the same variables for the adjustment as the Cox models. Corresponding adjusted odds ratios (ORs) along with their 95% CIs were reported. We also computed the 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year relative risks (RRs) of death along with their 95% CIs. The frequency of adverse events was compared between groups using the χ2 or Fisher exact tests when appropriate. All reported P values are 2-sided.\n\nResults\nStudy Description\nFrom October 9, 1995, to February 23, 1999, 1326 patients were screened and 300 patients (placebo, 149; corticosteroids, 151) were included in the study (Figure 1). Interim analyses were performed on April 3, 1997, and April 20, 1998, after the evaluation of 114 and 220 patients, respectively. After each analysis, the independent main end point and safety monitoring board advised the study chairpersons to continue the study. We included the patient in the placebo group who died before study drugs could be administered in our intent-to-treat analysis. One patient in the corticosteroid group was excluded from the final analysis because of consent withdrawal. Among the 299 remaining patients, there were 229 nonresponders (placebo, 115; corticosteroids, 114) and 70 responders (placebo, 34; corticosteroids, 36).\n\nCharacteristics of Study Patients at Inclusion\nAt baseline, the 2 groups were balanced with respect to general characteristics (Table 1) and severity of illness (Table 2).

Cortisol response to corticotropin was higher in the corticosteroid group than in the placebo group in the all-patients analysis, but the distribution of patients according to our 3-level prognostic classification8 was similar in the 2 groups. The type and site of infection and the type of organism involved were also similar in the 2 groups (Table 3). Finally, a blinded evaluation determined that appropriate antibiotic therapy, based on the site of infection and available cultures, was promptly (<24 hours from diagnosis of severe sepsis) started and continued for at least 7 days in most cases (ie, 95% in the placebo group, 91% in the corticosteroid group).\n\nMortality Distribution\nNonresponders\nAt day 28, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 12 days in the placebo group and 24 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47-0.95; P = .02; Figure 2A). The number of patients needed to treat to save 1 additional life at day 28 is 7 (95% CI, 4-49).\n\nResponders\nAt day 28, there were 18 deaths (53%) in the placebo group and 22 deaths (61%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 14 days in the placebo group and 16.5 days in the corticosteroid group. The proportionality assumption was not supported for the Cox model and comparison of survival distributions was performed using a log-rank test (P = .81) (Figure 2B).\n\nAll Patients\nAt day 28, there were 91 deaths (61%) in the placebo group and 82 deaths (55%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 13 days in the placebo group and 19.5 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.53-0.97; P = .03) (Figure 2C). The number of patients needed to treat to save 1 additional life at day 28 is 8 (95% CI, 5-81).\n\nMortality Rates\nNonresponders\nAs mentioned above, at day 28, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66-1.04; adjusted OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.97; P = .04). There were 81 deaths (70%) in the placebo group and 66 deaths (58%) in the corticosteroid group at the end of ICU stay (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-1.00; adjusted OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.89; P = .02). A similar significant difference was observed at the end of hospital stay. There were 88 deaths (77%) in the placebo group and 77 deaths (68%) in the corticosteroid group after 1 year of follow-up (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75-1.04; adjusted OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.31-1.04; P = .07) (Table 4).\n\nResponders\nThere was no significant effect of corticosteroids on 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates in responders (Table 4).\n\nAll Patients\nThere was no significant effect of corticosteroids on 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates in all patients. For example, the ICU mortality is represented by RR, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.75-1.05), adjusted OR, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.37-1.02), P = .06 and year of follow-up is represented by RR, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.78-1.04), adjusted OR, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.36-1.05), P = .08 (Table 4).\n\nTime-to-Vasopressor-Therapy Withdrawal\nNonresponders\nThe median time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal was 10 days in the placebo group and 7 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 1.91 (95% CI, 1.29-2.84; P = .001) (Figure 3A). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 46 patients (40%) in the placebo group and in 65 patients (57%) in the corticosteroid group.\n\nResponders\nThe median time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal was 7 days in the placebo group\n######################\nOutput:"

Among the 299 remaining patients, there were 229 nonresponders (placebo, 115; corticosteroids, 114) and 70 responders (placebo, 34; corticosteroids, 36).\n\nCharacteristics of Study Patients at Inclusion\nAt baseline, the 2 groups were balanced with respect to general characteristics (Table 1) and severity of illness (Table 2). Cortisol response to corticotropin was higher in the corticosteroid group than in the placebo group in the all-patients analysis, but the distribution of patients according to our 3-level prognostic classification8 was similar in the 2 groups. The type and site of infection and the type of organism involved were also similar in the 2 groups (Table 3). Finally, a blinded evaluation determined that appropriate antibiotic therapy, based on the site of infection and available cultures, was promptly (<24 hours from diagnosis of severe sepsis) started and continued for at least 7 days in most cases (ie, 95% in the placebo group, 91% in the corticosteroid group).\n\nMortality Distribution\nNonresponders\nAt day 28, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 12 days in the placebo group and 24 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47-0.95; P = .02; Figure 2A). The number of patients needed to treat to save 1 additional life at day 28 is 7 (95% CI, 4-49).\n\nResponders\nAt day 28, there were 18 deaths (53%) in the placebo group and 22 deaths (61%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 14 days in the placebo group and 16.5 days in the corticosteroid group. The proportionality assumption was not supported for the Cox model and comparison of survival distributions was performed using a log-rank test (P = .81) (Figure 2B).\n\nAll Patients\nAt day 28, there were 91 deaths (61%) in the placebo group and 82 deaths (55%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 13 days in the placebo group and 19.5 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.53-0.97; P = .03) (Figure 2C). The number of patients needed to treat to save 1 additional life at day 28 is 8 (95% CI, 5-81).\n\nMortality Rates\nNonresponders\nAs mentioned above, at day 28, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66-1.04; adjusted OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.97; P = .04). There were 81 deaths (70%) in the placebo group and 66 deaths (58%) in the corticosteroid group at the end of ICU stay (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-1.00; adjusted OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.89; P = .02). A similar significant difference was observed at the end of hospital stay. There were 88 deaths (77%) in the placebo group and 77 deaths (68%) in the corticosteroid group after 1 year of follow-up (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75-1.04; adjusted OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.31-1.04; P = .07) (Table 4).\n\nResponders\nThere was no significant effect of corticosteroids on 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates in responders (Table 4).\n\nAll Patients\nThere was no significant effect of corticosteroids on 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates in all patients. For example, the ICU mortality is represented by RR, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.75-1.05), adjusted OR, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.37-1.02), P = .06 and year of follow-up is represented by RR, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.78-1.04), adjusted OR, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.36-1.05), P = .08 (Table 4).\n\nTime-to-Vasopressor-Therapy Withdrawal\nNonresponders\nThe median time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal was 10 days in the placebo group and 7 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 1.91 (95% CI, 1.29-2.84; P = .001) (Figure 3A). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 46 patients (40%) in the placebo group and in 65 patients (57%) in the corticosteroid group.\n\nResponders\nThe median time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal was 7 days in the placebo group"

The primary outcome was death from any cause 28 days after randomization.\nResults\nAt 28 days, 223 of 846 patients (26.4%) in the DrotAA group and 202 of 834 (24.2%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk in the DrotAA group, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.28; P=0.31). At 90 days, 287 of 842 patients (34.1%) in the DrotAA group and 269 of 822 (32.7%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.19; P=0.56). Among patients with severe protein C deficiency at baseline, 98 of 342 (28.7%) in the DrotAA group had died at 28 days, as compared with 102 of 331 (30.8%) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.17; P=0.54). Similarly, rates of death at 28 and 90 days were not significantly different in other predefined subgroups, including patients at increased risk for death. Serious bleeding during the treatment period occurred in 10 patients in the DrotAA group and 8 in the placebo group (P=0.81).\nConclusions\nDrotAA did not significantly reduce mortality at 28 or 90 days, as compared with placebo, in patients with septic shock. (Funded by Eli Lilly; PROWESS-SHOCK ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00604214.)\nRecombinant human activated protein C, or drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DrotAA), was approved for the treatment of severe sepsis in 2001 on the basis of the Prospective Recombinant Human Activated Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis (PROWESS) study,1 a phase 3 international, randomized, controlled trial that was stopped early for efficacy after the enrollment of 1690 patients with severe sepsis. Absolute mortality in the intention-to-treat population was reduced by 6.1 percentage points, a relative risk reduction of 19.4%. Subsequent subgroup analysis suggested that the mortality benefit was limited to patients with increased illness severity (i.e., those with more than one sepsis-related dysfunctional organ or with an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II score2 of more than 24 [on a scale of 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating an increased risk of death]). The Food and Drug Administration limited its approval of the drug for use in patients with “a high risk of death” and requested additional trials involving less severely ill adults and children. These trials were terminated early for futility by independent data and safety monitoring committees.3,4 Moreover, subgroups of patients at increased risk for death within the adult trial did not appear to benefit from the use of DrotAA. The lack of confirmatory data from placebo-controlled trials5 called into question the results of the PROWESS study and thus the efficacy of the drug.6\nDrotAA received marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of adults with severe sepsis and multiple organ failure, but the approval was subject to annual review.7 In 2007, the agency concluded that sufficient doubt existed to warrant a new placebo-controlled trial.8 We conducted the PROWESS-SHOCK study to test the hypothesis that DrotAA, as compared with placebo, would reduce mortality in patients with septic shock.9\nMethods\nStudy Patients\nThe study protocol has been published previously (www.springerlink.com/content/t3353213r20835ul/fulltext.pdf).9 The trial was approved by the institutional review board at each study center, and written informed consent was obtained from patients or their legally authorized surrogates in accordance with local requirements.\nAdult patients were eligible for inclusion if they had sepsis (infection and two or more signs of systemic inflammation), shock, and clinical evidence of hypoperfusion. We defined hypoperfusion as metabolic acidosis (base deficit, ≥5.0 mmol per liter; venous bicarbonate, <18 mmol per liter; or lactate, >2.5 mmol per liter) or renal or hepatic dysfunction. (Case definitions are provided in the protocol.) We defined shock as the need for treatment with norepinephrine at a dose of at least 5 μg per minute or an equivalent dose of another vasopressor for 4 hours or more, provided that at least 30 ml per kilogram of body weight of crystalloid or an equivalent volume of colloid was administered during the 8-hour interval surrounding the start of vasopressor treatment. We required that patients remain refractory to reasonable attempts to wean vasopressors and begin study treatment within 24 hours after the first dose of a vasopressor.

At 90 days, 287 of 842 patients (34.1%) in the DrotAA group and 269 of 822 (32.7%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.19; P=0.56). Among patients with severe protein C deficiency at baseline, 98 of 342 (28.7%) in the DrotAA group had died at 28 days, as compared with 102 of 331 (30.8%) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.17; P=0.54). Similarly, rates of death at 28 and 90 days were not significantly different in other predefined subgroups, including patients at increased risk for death. Serious bleeding during the treatment period occurred in 10 patients in the DrotAA group and 8 in the placebo group (P=0.81).\nConclusions\nDrotAA did not significantly reduce mortality at 28 or 90 days, as compared with placebo, in patients with septic shock. (Funded by Eli Lilly; PROWESS-SHOCK ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00604214.)\nRecombinant human activated protein C, or drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DrotAA), was approved for the treatment of severe sepsis in 2001 on the basis of the Prospective Recombinant Human Activated Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis (PROWESS) study,1 a phase 3 international, randomized, controlled trial that was stopped early for efficacy after the enrollment of 1690 patients with severe sepsis. Absolute mortality in the intention-to-treat population was reduced by 6.1 percentage points, a relative risk reduction of 19.4%. Subsequent subgroup analysis suggested that the mortality benefit was limited to patients with increased illness severity (i.e., those with more than one sepsis-related dysfunctional organ or with an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II score2 of more than 24 [on a scale of 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating an increased risk of death]). The Food and Drug Administration limited its approval of the drug for use in patients with “a high risk of death” and requested additional trials involving less severely ill adults and children. These trials were terminated early for futility by independent data and safety monitoring committees.3,4 Moreover, subgroups of patients at increased risk for death within the adult trial did not appear to benefit from the use of DrotAA. The lack of confirmatory data from placebo-controlled trials5 called into question the results of the PROWESS study and thus the efficacy of the drug.6\nDrotAA received marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of adults with severe sepsis and multiple organ failure, but the approval was subject to annual review.7 In 2007, the agency concluded that sufficient doubt existed to warrant a new placebo-controlled trial.8 We conducted the PROWESS-SHOCK study to test the hypothesis that DrotAA, as compared with placebo, would reduce mortality in patients with septic shock.9\nMethods\nStudy Patients\nThe study protocol has been published previously (www.springerlink.com/content/t3353213r20835ul/fulltext.pdf).9 The trial was approved by the institutional review board at each study center, and written informed consent was obtained from patients or their legally authorized surrogates in accordance with local requirements.\nAdult patients were eligible for inclusion if they had sepsis (infection and two or more signs of systemic inflammation), shock, and clinical evidence of hypoperfusion. We defined hypoperfusion as metabolic acidosis (base deficit, ≥5.0 mmol per liter; venous bicarbonate, <18 mmol per liter; or lactate, >2.5 mmol per liter) or renal or hepatic dysfunction. (Case definitions are provided in the protocol.) We defined shock as the need for treatment with norepinephrine at a dose of at least 5 μg per minute or an equivalent dose of another vasopressor for 4 hours or more, provided that at least 30 ml per kilogram of body weight of crystalloid or an equivalent volume of colloid was administered during the 8-hour interval surrounding the start of vasopressor treatment. We required that patients remain refractory to reasonable attempts to wean vasopressors and begin study treatment within 24 hours after the first dose of a vasopressor.

All safety analyses were conducted in the population of treated patients.\nResults\nStudy Patients\nAggregate mortality after recruitment of 750 patients was 27.6%. Therefore, we increased the sample size to 1696 on May 12, 2010. Patients were enrolled from March 2008 through August 2011 at 208 sites in Europe, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, and India (for details, see the Supplementary Appendix). From 27,816 potential patients, we recruited 1697, with 852 assigned to receive DrotAA and 845 assigned to receive placebo. We were able to evaluate the primary outcome in 1680 patients (99.0%) (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\n\nScreening, Randomization, and Follow-up of the Study Patients.\nA total of 71.7% of patients were recruited at European sites and 14.1% at North American sites, with 14.2% recruited from other countries. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix): 56.4% of the patients were men, and the mean (±SD) ages were 63.4±15.4 years in the DrotAA group versus 62.7±16.4 years in the placebo group. The mean APACHE II scores were 25.2±8.1 and 25.5±8.1 in the DrotAA and placebo groups, respectively; 84.1% of the patients had dysfunction of three or more organs.\nThe site of infection, cultured organisms, and antimicrobial treatments were similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The most common sites of infection were the lung, abdomen, and urinary tract. A causative pathogen was identified before starting study treatment in 1198 of 1696 patients (70.6%); 509 of 1696 patients (30.0%) had positive blood cultures. The median time from the initiation of antibiotics to initial vasopressor therapy was 2.5 hours (interquartile range, 0 to 7.1) in the DrotAA group and 2.5 hours (interquartile range, 0 to 8.6) in the placebo group (P=0.98). The control of infection at the presumed source was accomplished in 275 of 303 patients (90.8%) in the DrotAA group and 264 of 295 (89.5%) in the placebo group (P=0.60).\nTable 1\n\nSite and Cause of Infection.\nStudy Treatment and Cointerventions\nStudy treatment was administered to 1666 of 1696 patients (98.2%) and was interrupted at least once in 593 of 1666 patients (35.6%). The mean total duration of study treatment was 83.3±26.7 hours in the DrotAA group and 85.1±25.1 hours in the placebo group. The major reason for interrupting a study treatment was an invasive procedure (in 215 of 306 patients with interruptions [70.3%] in the DrotAA group vs. 238 of 287 [82.9%] in the placebo group). Study treatment was stopped prematurely in 216 of 833 patients (25.9%) in the DrotAA group and 191 of 833 (22.9%) in the placebo group. In the two groups, the most common reason for premature discontinuation was the patient's death (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The proportions of patients receiving glucocorticoids and anticoagulants were also similar in the two groups, as were the number and site of surgical procedures performed during the treatment period (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nOutcomes\nThe status of patients at 28 days is provided in Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix. At 28 days, 223 of 846 patients (26.4%) in the DrotAA group and 202 of 834 (24.2%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk in the DrotAA group, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.28; P=0.31). At 90 days, 287 of 842 patients (34.1%) in the DrotAA group and 269 of 822 (32.7%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.19; P=0.56) (Table 2). In addition, the time-to-event analysis at 90 days showed similar results (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.26; P=0.43 by the log-rank test) (Figure 2A). There was no significant heterogeneity in the treatment effect on mortality at 28 days and 90 days in the prespecified subgroups (Figure 2B, and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Changes in organ function during the 7-day study period did not differ significantly in the two groups (Table 2). Protein C activity increased from baseline during the first 6 days in both groups; the mean increase was significantly greater in patients in the DrotAA group than in the placebo group on each of the first 4 study days (P<0.001) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nProbability of Survival and Odds Ratios for Death, According to Subgroup.\nTable 2\n######################\nOutput:"

The control of infection at the presumed source was accomplished in 275 of 303 patients (90.8%) in the DrotAA group and 264 of 295 (89.5%) in the placebo group (P=0.60).\nTable 1\n\nSite and Cause of Infection.\nStudy Treatment and Cointerventions\nStudy treatment was administered to 1666 of 1696 patients (98.2%) and was interrupted at least once in 593 of 1666 patients (35.6%). The mean total duration of study treatment was 83.3±26.7 hours in the DrotAA group and 85.1±25.1 hours in the placebo group. The major reason for interrupting a study treatment was an invasive procedure (in 215 of 306 patients with interruptions [70.3%] in the DrotAA group vs. 238 of 287 [82.9%] in the placebo group). Study treatment was stopped prematurely in 216 of 833 patients (25.9%) in the DrotAA group and 191 of 833 (22.9%) in the placebo group. In the two groups, the most common reason for premature discontinuation was the patient's death (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The proportions of patients receiving glucocorticoids and anticoagulants were also similar in the two groups, as were the number and site of surgical procedures performed during the treatment period (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nOutcomes\nThe status of patients at 28 days is provided in Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix. At 28 days, 223 of 846 patients (26.4%) in the DrotAA group and 202 of 834 (24.2%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk in the DrotAA group, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.28; P=0.31). At 90 days, 287 of 842 patients (34.1%) in the DrotAA group and 269 of 822 (32.7%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.19; P=0.56) (Table 2). In addition, the time-to-event analysis at 90 days showed similar results (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.26; P=0.43 by the log-rank test) (Figure 2A). There was no significant heterogeneity in the treatment effect on mortality at 28 days and 90 days in the prespecified subgroups (Figure 2B, and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Changes in organ function during the 7-day study period did not differ significantly in the two groups (Table 2). Protein C activity increased from baseline during the first 6 days in both groups; the mean increase was significantly greater in patients in the DrotAA group than in the placebo group on each of the first 4 study days (P<0.001) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nProbability of Survival and Odds Ratios for Death, According to Subgroup.\nTable 2"

Treatment assignments were concealed from the investigators assessing mortality, the data and safety monitoring committee, and the trial statistician. The conduct of the trial and the safety of the participants were overseen by the data and safety monitoring committee, which performed an interim analysis after 500 patients had been followed for 90 days. The trial data were monitored by staff from the coordinating center.\nTrial Patients\nWe screened patients 18 years of age or older who were in the ICU, fulfilled the criteria for septic shock,18 and had a blood concentration of hemoglobin of 9 g per deciliter or less as measured by means of valid point-of-care testing (see the Supplementary Appendix). The reasons for the exclusion of some patients are shown in Figure 1 and listed in the Supplementary Appendix.\nFigure 1\n\nAssessment, Randomization, and Follow-up.\nIntervention\nEnrolled patients were given single units of cross-matched, prestorage leukoreduced red cells suspended in a saline–adenine–glucose–mannitol solution when the blood concentration of hemoglobin had decreased to the assigned transfusion threshold (≤7 g per deciliter [lower threshold] or ≤9 g per deciliter [higher threshold]). These levels of hemoglobin have frequently been used as thresholds for transfusion in patients with septic shock.15 Hemoglobin concentrations were reassessed within 3 hours after termination of the transfusion or before the initiation of another transfusion. The intervention period was the entire ICU stay, to a maximum of 90 days after randomization.\nIn the event that life-threatening bleeding or ischemia developed while a patient was in the ICU or a patient required the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, the patient could receive a transfusion at a hemoglobin threshold decided by the attending doctor. The attending doctor decided when the patient again was to receive a transfusion at the assigned hemoglobin threshold. After the unmasking of trial data showing harm from hydroxyethyl starch,3 we recommended against the use of all starch products in trial patients. All other interventions were at the discretion of the clinicians, including transfusion during surgery and after ICU discharge.\nOutcome Measures\nThe primary outcome measure was death by 90 days after randomization. Secondary outcome measures were the use of life support (defined as the use of vasopressor or inotropic therapy, mechanical ventilation, or renal-replacement therapy) at days 5, 14, and 28 after randomization19; the number of patients with serious adverse reactions while in the ICU (allergic reaction, hemolysis, transfusion-associated acute lung injury, or transfusion-associated circulatory overload) (see the Supplementary Appendix); the number of patients with ischemic events while in the ICU, which included cerebral ischemia (identified from the results of imaging), acute myocardial ischemia (defined by symptoms, electrocardiographic signs, or elevated biomarker levels resulting in an intervention), intestinal ischemia (as observed during endoscopic examination or surgery), or limb ischemia (defined as clinical signs resulting in an intervention) (for full definitions, see the Supplementary Appendix); the percentage of days alive without vasopressor or inotropic therapy, mechanical ventilation, or renal-replacement therapy in the 90 days after randomization; and the percentage of days alive and out of the hospital in the 90 days after randomization. Data for the outcome measures were obtained by TRISS trial investigators or their delegates from patient files and national and regional registries for the entire 90-day follow-up period.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe calculated that we would need to enroll 1000 patients for the trial to have 80% power to show mortality at 90 days that was 9 percentage points lower in the lower-threshold group than in the higher-threshold group, at a two-sided alpha level of 5%, assuming a mortality in the higher-threshold group of 45% (estimated from two previous cohorts).20,21 The estimated difference of 9 percentage points was derived from the 20% reduction in relative risk observed with a restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategy in the subgroup of patients with severe infection in the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) trial.9 During our trial, 5 patients were excluded after randomization (4 patients did not allow the use of their data, and 1 did not have sepsis, which was realized immediately after randomization). A total of 5 additional patients underwent randomization in order for the study to obtain the full sample (Figure 1).\nAn author who was the statistician for the study and who was unaware of the study-group assignments performed all the analyses according to International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines22 and the statistical analysis plan.15 We performed the primary analyses in the intention-to-treat population, which included all the patients who underwent randomization, except for those whose data were deleted from the database during the trial (i.e., the 5 patients, noted above, who were excluded after randomization) and after the trial (2 patients who withdrew consent for the use of their data) (Figure 1). In the per-protocol populations, we excluded patients who had one or more bleeding or ischemic episodes or one or more major protocol violations (see the Supplementary Appendix).22\nIn the primary analyses (including the analysis of the primary outcome measure), we compared data between the two groups by means of logistic-regression analysis for binary outcome\n######################\nOutput:"

In the per-protocol populations, we excluded patients who had one or more bleeding or ischemic episodes or one or more major protocol violations (see the Supplementary Appendix).22\nIn the primary analyses (including the analysis of the primary outcome measure), we compared data between the two groups by means of logistic-regression analysis for binary outcome"

Exclusion criteria are listed in Figure 1.\nFigure 1\n\nRandomization and Follow-up of the Patients, According to Study Group.\nThe trial was monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring board. Randomization and blinding regarding the study-group assignments were performed according to Consolidated Standards for the Reporting of Trials (CONSORT) guidelines, as indicated in the Supplementary Appendix (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The study protocol and statistical analysis plan (also available at NEJM.org) were approved for all centers by the ethics committee of the Marseille University Hospital (Comité Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biomédicale), according to French law. The study was conducted in accordance with the protocol and statistical analysis plan. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients or their proxies.\nStudy Treatment\nCisatracurium besylate (150-mg formulation, GlaxoSmithKline) and placebo were prepared in identical separate 30-ml vials for intravenous infusion. Peripheral-nerve stimulators were not permitted. The Ramsay sedation scale was used to adapt sedative requirements. The scale assigns the conscious state a score of 1 (anxious, agitated, or restless) to 6 (no response on glabellar tap). Once the assigned Ramsay sedation score was 6 and the ventilator settings were adjusted (Table 1), a 3-ml rapid intravenous infusion of 15 mg of cisatracurium besylate or placebo was administered, followed by a continuous infusion of 37.5 mg per hour for 48 hours. This regimen was based on the results of two studies of a total of 92 patients monitored for paralysis.13,15\nTable 1\n\nSummary of the Ventilation Procedure.\nVentilation and Weaning Protocol\nThe volume assist–control mode of ventilation was used, with a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight (Table 1). The goal was a saturation of peripheral blood oxygen (SpO2) as measured by means of pulse oximetry of 88 to 95% or a PaO2 of 55 to 80 mm Hg. To achieve this goal, FIO2 and the positive end-expiratory pressure were adjusted as in the Prospective, Randomized, Multi-Center Trial of 12 ml/kg Tidal Volume Positive Pressure Ventilation for Treatment of Acute Lung Injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARMA).14\nAn open-label, rapid, intravenous injection of 20 mg of cisatracurium was allowed in both groups if the end-inspiratory plateau pressure remained greater than 32 cm of water for at least 10 minutes despite the administration of increasing doses of sedatives and decreasing tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure (if tolerated). If this rapid, intravenous injection resulted in a decrease of the end-inspiratory plateau pressure by less than 2 cm of water, a second injection of 20 mg of cisatracurium was allowed. If after the injection, the end-inspiratory plateau pressure did not decrease or decreased by less than 2 cm of water, cisatracurium was not administered again during the following 24-hour period.\nOrgan or System Failure\nPatients were monitored daily for 28 days for signs of failure of nonpulmonary organs or systems.14 Circulatory failure was defined as systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less or the need for vasopressor therapy. Coagulation failure was defined as a platelet count of 80,000 or less per cubic millimeter. Hepatic failure was defined as a serum bilirubin level of 2 mg per deciliter (34 μmol per liter) or higher. Renal failure was defined as a serum creatinine level of 2 mg per deciliter (177 μmol per liter) or higher. The number of days without organ or system failure was calculated by subtracting the number of days with organ failure from 28 days or from the number of days until death, if death occurred before day 28. Organs and systems were considered to be free of failure after hospital discharge. There was no recommendation regarding volume-resuscitation goals.\nData Collection\nDuring the 24-hour period before randomization, we recorded data on demographic characteristics, physiological variables, relevant interventions performed in the ICU, radiographic findings, coexisting conditions, and medications. Data on ventilator settings, physiological variables, radiographic findings, and relevant therapeutic interventions were also recorded just before starting the study-drug infusion and again at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Physiological variables were also measured daily between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. until day 90 or until hospital discharge of a patient who could breath spontaneously.\nOpioid doses were converted to morphine equivalents. The equivalencies were as follows: 0.01 mg of sufentanil=10 mg of morphine=0.1 mg of fentanyl=0.1 mg of remifentanil.16\nBarotrauma was defined as newly developed pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, or pneumatocele larger than 2 cm in diameter. Muscle strength was evaluated with the use of the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, a previously validated scale that assesses three muscle groups in each arm and leg. The score for each muscle group can range from 0 (paralysis) to 5 (normal strength), with the overall score ranging from 0 to 60.17 The definition of\n######################\nOutput:"

Because the trial was multicenter and large and used stratified randomization, it is unlikely that imbalance in concomitant interventions affected the results. Second, the confidence interval was relatively wide for the point estimate for mortality, so we cannot exclude a 9% relative increase or a 22% relative decrease in mortality at 90 days in the lower-threshold group versus the higher-threshold group. Third, we had limited power to detect differences in some other outcome measures (in particular, the ischemic events) and in some of the subgroup analyses (in particular, the subgroup defined according to the presence or absence of chronic cardiovascular disease).\nWe recorded only one serious adverse reaction to blood transfusion, but serious adverse reactions are rare events in general, and their frequencies are unknown among patients with septic shock in the ICU. We included some patients who had received a blood transfusion before ICU admission, and some patients had protocol suspensions and violations, which tended to reduce the difference between the two intervention groups. However, we found clear differences between the two groups in the hemoglobin levels and the numbers of transfusions, and the per-protocol analyses, which excluded patients who had protocol suspensions and violations, supported the primary analysis. Protocol suspensions and violations have been difficult to prevent in transfusion trials,32,33 and when reported they appear to have occurred at frequencies similar to those observed in our trial.\nIn conclusion, patients with septic shock who underwent transfusion at a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g per deciliter, as compared with those who underwent transfusion at a hemoglobin threshold of 9 g per deciliter, received fewer transfusions and had similar mortality at 90 days, use of life support, and number of days alive and out of the hospital; the numbers of patients with ischemic events and severe adverse reactions to blood in the ICU were also similar in the two intervention groups.\n######################\nOutput:"

Written informed consent had to be obtained from the patients themselves or their relatives and a short corticotropin test had to be performed before randomization. Finally, patients had to be randomized within 3 hours of the onset of shock.\n\nPatients were excluded if they were pregnant or had evidence for acute myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism, advanced form of cancer or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection, and contraindication or formal indication for corticosteroids.\n\nDuring recruitment, we refined the eligibility criteria by not making the arterial lactate requirement mandatory (the 6th criterion) but adding it as an option to the 5th criterion. We also increased the maximum delay from the onset of septic shock and randomization from 3 to 8 hours (amendment of July 18, 1996); and we excluded patients who received etomidate during the 6 hours preceding randomization because it is a selective inhibitor of the 11 β-hydroxylase and therefore could interfere with cortisol response to corticotropin (amendment of June 19, 1997).\n\nRandomization\nRandomization was centrally performed, concealed, and stratified by center in blocks of 4 according to a computer-generated random number table. In each center, sequentially numbered boxes containing the whole treatment for each patient were delivered to the investigator by the pharmacist following the order of the randomization list. All patients, medical and nursing staffs, and pharmacists remained blinded throughout the study period.\n\nTreatments\nHydrocortisone came in vials containing 100 mg of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder and ampoules containing 2 mL of glucose solution solvent, which was administered intravenously every 6 hours as a 50-mg bolus (Roussel-Uclaf, Romainville, France). One tablet containing 50 µg of 9-α-fludrocortisone was administered daily through a nasogastric tube with 10 to 40 mL of water over 30 seconds (Pharmacie Centrale des Hôpitaux, Paris, France). Placebos were indiscernible from active treatments. Treatment duration was 7 days.\n\nData Collection at Inclusion\nClinical Evaluation\nThe following data were recorded: (1) general characteristics including estimated prognosis of any underlying disease17 and level of activity limitation18; (2) severity of illness assessed by vital signs, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II),19 and Logistic Organ Dysfunction (LOD) score20; and (3) interventions including the volume of fluid infusion and the type and doses of vasopressors and antibiotics.\n\nLaboratory Variables\nHematological and chemistry data, arterial lactate and blood gas determinations, and blood cultures and cultures of specimen drawn from the site of infection were done systematically. The short corticotropin test was performed using a 250-µg intravenous bolus of tetracosactrin (Synacthène Ciba, Rueil-Malmaison, France). Blood samples were taken immediately before the test and 30 and 60 minutes after the test. After centrifugation, plasma samples were stored at −80°C until assayed. Cortisol was measured blindly and serially before interim and final statistical analyses using Immunotech radioimmunoassay.21 To reduce heterogeneity in cortisol determination, all plasma samples were measured at a central laboratory. Cortisol response was defined as the difference between the highest of the concentrations taken after the test and those taken before the test. Relative adrenal insufficiency (ie, nonresponders) was defined by a response of 9 µg/dL or less.7,8\n\nFollow-up\nThe following data were recorded daily during the 28-day period following randomization: vital signs, results from standard laboratory tests and cultures of specimen drawn from any new site of infection, and interventions. In addition, the patient's status at discharge from ICU and hospital and 1 year after randomization was recorded.\n\nEnd Points\nThe main end point was the 28-day survival distribution from randomization in nonresponders to the short corticotropin test. Secondary end points were 28-day survival distributions from randomization in responders to the short corticotropin test and in all patients; 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates; and time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal during the 28 days from randomization in the 2 subsets of patients and in all patients.\n\nAdverse events were carefully monitored and classified as being possibly related to corticosteroids (superinfection, gastrointestinal bleeding, psychiatric disorders), possibly related to vasopress\n######################\nOutput:"

In the per-protocol populations, we excluded patients who had one or more bleeding or ischemic episodes or one or more major protocol violations (see the Supplementary Appendix).22\nIn the primary analyses (including the analysis of the primary outcome measure), we compared data between the two groups by means of logistic-regression analysis for binary outcome measures with adjustment for the stratification variables (study site and presence or absence of active hematologic cancer),23 and we converted odds ratios to relative risks.24 We also performed unadjusted chi-square testing for binary outcome measures and Wilcoxon signed-rank testing for rate and ordinal data. We compared the primary outcome in the per-protocol populations and in prespecified subgroups defined according to the presence or absence of chronic cardiovascular disease (i.e., any history of myocardial infarction, any history of stable or unstable angina pectoris, previous treatment with nitrates, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary-artery bypass grafting or noncoronary vascular interventions, any history of chronic heart failure [defined as New York Heart Association class III or IV], or any history of cerebral infarction or transitory cerebral ischemia), an age of 70 years or younger versus an age older than 70 years, and a Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II above 53 versus 53 or lower at baseline (with the score calculated from 17 variables and ranging from 0 to 163, with higher scores indicating higher severity of disease) and used multiple logistic-regression analyses in the intention-to-treat population to adjust for differences in prespecified risk factors at baseline. Details regarding the handling of missing data are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. We performed all analyses using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Software), and SPSS software, version 17.0 (SPSS). A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.\nResults\nTrial Population\nWe obtained 90-day vital status for 998 patients (99.3%), including 502 in the lower-threshold group and 496 in the higher-threshold group (Figure 1). The characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). A total of 29 of 488 patients (5.9%) in the lower-threshold group and 11 of 489 (2.2%) in the higher-threshold group had the protocol temporarily suspended (P=0.004) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Trial Patients at Baseline.\nHemoglobin Concentrations, Blood Products, and Circulatory Variables\nThe median value of the lowest concentration of hemoglobin in the 24 hours before randomization was 8.4 g per deciliter in both intervention groups. After randomization, the daily lowest concentrations of hemoglobin differed between the two groups (P<0.001) (Figure 2). Additional details regarding hemoglobin assessments are provided in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nFigure 2\n\nBlood Hemoglobin Levels in Patients in the ICU at Baseline and after Randomization.\nDuring the trial period, a total of 1545 blood transfusions were given in the lower-threshold group and 3088 transfusions in the higher-threshold group (P<0.001). The median cumulative number of blood transfusions after randomization was 1 unit (interquartile range, 0 to 3) in the lower-threshold group and 4 (interquartile range, 2 to 7) in the higher-threshold group (P<0.001). A total of 176 patients (36.1%) in the lower-threshold group did not undergo transfusion in the ICU, as compared with 6 (1.2%) in the higher-threshold group (P<0.001). Details regarding blood products, bleeding, cointerventions, fluid volumes and balances, and circulatory assessments are provided in Tables S4 through S9 in the Supplementary Appendix. The numbers of protocol violations differed significantly between the two groups (Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nOutcomes\nAt 90 days after randomization, 216 patients (43.0%) in the lower-threshold group and 223 (45.0%) in the higher-threshold group had died (relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.09; P=0.44) (Table 2 and Figure 3, and Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix). We obtained similar results in the analyses that were adjusted for prespecified baseline risk factors and in the per-protocol analyses (Table S12 in the Supplementary Appendix). The prespecified subgroup analyses showed no significant heterogeneity in the effect of the transfusion threshold on mortality at 90 days between patients with and those without chronic cardiovascular disease, patients 70 years of age or younger and those older than 70 years of age, and patients with a SAPS II of 53 or less and those with a SAPS II of more than 53 at baseline (Figure 3).\nFigure 3\n\nTime to Death and Relative Risk of Death at 90 Days.\nTable 2\n\nPrimary and Secondary Outcome Measures.\nA total of 7.2% of the patients in the lower-threshold group, as compared with 8.0% in the higher-threshold group, had one or more ischemic events in the ICU (Table 2, and Tables S13 and S14 in the Supplementary Appendix, which include the numbers of patients with myocardial ischemia and ischem\n######################\nOutput:"

The only significant difference between the two groups at baseline was a lower mean PaO2:FIO2 value in the cisatracurium group (P=0.03) (Table 2, and Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 2\n\nBaseline Characteristics of the Patients, According to Study Group.\nOutcomes\nPrimary Outcome\nThe Cox regression model yielded a hazard ratio for death at 90 days in the cisatracurium group, as compared with the placebo group, of 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.98; P=0.04), after adjustment for the baseline PaO2:FIO2, SAPS II, and plateau pressure (Figure 2). The crude 90-day mortality was 31.6% (95% CI, 25.2 to 38.8) in the cisatracurium group and 40.7% (95% CI, 33.5 to 48.4) in the placebo group (P=0.08).\nFigure 2\n\nProbability of Survival through Day 90, According to Study Group.\nSecondary Prespecified Outcomes\nThe beneficial effect of cisatracurium on the 90-day survival rate was confined to the two thirds of patients presenting with a PaO2:FIO2 ratio of less than 120. Among these patients, the 90-day mortality was 30.8% in the cisatracurium group and 44.6% in the control group (P=0.04) (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The absolute difference in 28-day mortality (mortality in the cisatracurium group minus mortality in the placebo group) was −9.6 percentage points (95% CI, −19.2 to −0.2; P=0.05) (Table 3).\nTable 3\n\nSecondary Outcomes, According to Study Group.\nThe cisatracurium group had significantly more ventilator-free days than the placebo group during the first 28 and 90 days (Table 3, and Figure 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The Cox regression model yielded an adjusted hazard ratio for weaning from mechanical ventilation by day 90, in the cisatracurium group as compared with the placebo group, of 1.41 (95% CI, 1.08 to 1.83; P=0.01). The cisatracurium group had more days free of failure of organs, other than the lungs, during the first 28 days (15.8±9.9 days, vs. 12.2±11.1 days in the placebo group; P=0.01). There were nearly significant between-group differences in the numbers of days without coagulation abnormalities, hepatic failure, and renal failure (Table 3). No patient required dialysis after hospital discharge during the first 28 days. Significantly more days were spent outside the ICU between day 1 and day 90 in the cisatracurium group.\nPneumothorax occurred in a larger proportion of patients in the placebo group (11.7%, vs. 4.0% in the cisatracurium group; P=0.01) and tended to develop earlier in the placebo group (Figure 4 in the Supplementary Appendix). During the 48-hour period of study-drug infusion, pneumothorax occurred in one patient (0.6%) in the cisatracurium group as compared with eight patients (4.9%) in the placebo group (P=0.03). The plateau pressures and minute ventilations for the nine patients are presented in Table 5 in the Supplementary Appendix. Before the development of pneumothorax, none of these patients had an elevated plateau pressure necessitating changes in the mechanical-ventilation settings, changes in the sedation regimen, or open-label administration of cisatracurium.\nThe incidence of ICU-acquired paresis, as evaluated on the basis of the MRC score on day 28 or at the time of ICU discharge, did not differ significantly between the two groups (Table 3).\nSecondary Post Hoc Outcome\nCorticosteroids were used during the ICU stay in 189 patients. There was no significant effect of cisatracurium use on the 90-day mortality in the subgroup of patients given corticosteroids (Figure 6 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nVentilator Settings and Lung Function\nVentilator settings and lung-function variables during the first week are given in Table 7 in the Supplementary Appendix. On day 7, the PaO2:FIO2 ratio was higher, and the PaCO2 value lower, in the cisatracurium group than in the placebo group.\nCointerventions\nDuring the ICU stay, there were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of cointerventions. A total of 42% of patients in the cisatracurium group and 48% in the placebo group were treated with the use of prone positioning, inhaled nitric oxide, intravenous almitrine mesylate, or a combination of these (Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The criteria for using these interventions were the same in the two groups.\nOpen-label cisatracurium was given more frequently in the placebo group than in the cisatracurium group during the first 48 hours after enrollment. However, the two groups did not differ significantly with respect to the number of patients given at least one open-label cisatracurium bolus during the entire ICU stay after enrollment (Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix).

In the albumin group, the target serum albumin concentration was 30 g per liter or more until discharge from the ICU or 28 days after randomization. The primary outcome was death from any cause at 28 days. Secondary outcomes were death from any cause at 90 days, the number of patients with organ dysfunction and the degree of dysfunction, and length of stay in the ICU and the hospital.\nResults\nDuring the first 7 days, patients in the albumin group, as compared with those in the crystalloid group, had a higher mean arterial pressure (P=0.03) and lower net fluid balance (P<0.001). The total daily amount of administered fluid did not differ significantly between the two groups (P=0.10). At 28 days, 285 of 895 patients (31.8%) in the albumin group and 288 of 900 (32.0%) in the crystalloid group had died (relative risk in the albumin group, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87 to 1.14; P=0.94). At 90 days, 365 of 888 patients (41.1%) in the albumin group and 389 of 893 (43.6%) in the crystalloid group had died (relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.05; P=0.29). No significant differences in other secondary outcomes were observed between the two groups.\nConclusions\nIn patients with severe sepsis, albumin replacement in addition to crystalloids, as compared with crystalloids alone, did not improve the rate of survival at 28 and 90 days. (Funded by the Italian Medicines Agency; ALBIOS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00707122.)\nFor decades, human albumin has been administered to patients to provide adequate oncotic pressure and intravascular volume.1 In 1998, however, a report from the Cochrane Injuries Group Albumin Reviewers indicated that the administration of albumin may be potentially harmful in critically ill patients, as compared with the administration of crystalloid solutions.2 Subsequent meta-analyses reported contradictory findings.3,4\nTo clarify this issue, a large, double-blind, randomized trial (the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation [SAFE] study)5 was conducted, in which 4% albumin solution was compared with normal saline as fluid replacement in critically ill patients, with results indicating that albumin administration was safe. A predefined subgroup analysis showed that patients with severe sepsis receiving albumin were at a lower, although not significantly lower, risk for death than those receiving normal saline. In addition, a subsequent study pointed out a potential benefit of maintaining serum albumin at a level of more than 30 g per liter in critically ill patients.6\nThere is a convincing rationale for the potential advantages of albumin administration during severe sepsis.7 Albumin is the main protein responsible for plasma colloid osmotic pressure8; it acts as a carrier for several endogenous and exogenous compounds,9 with antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties, and as a scavenger of reactive oxygen10,11 and nitrogen12 species and operates as a buffer molecule for acid–base equilibrium.13 We therefore conducted a randomized, controlled trial to investigate the effects of the administration of albumin and crystalloids, as compared with crystalloids alone, targeting a serum albumin level of 30 g per liter or more in a population of patients with severe sepsis.\nMethods\nStudy Oversight and Design\nWe conducted the Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis (ALBIOS) study — an investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial — in 100 intensive care units (ICUs) in Italy. The members of the steering committee (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) designed the study, were responsible for its execution and for the data analysis, made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication, and assume responsibility for the fidelity of the study to the protocol (available at NEJM.org).\nThe trial was funded by the Italian Medicines Agency, which had no role in the conduct of the study, the reporting of the data, or the supply of study fluids. Albumin administered during the study was provided by each participating institution as part of the clinical treatment of critically ill patients. The study protocol and the informed-consent process were approved by the ethics committee at each participating institution.

        "text": "Abstract\nBackground\nAlthough previous studies have suggested the potential advantages of albumin administration in patients with severe sepsis, its efficacy has not been fully established.\nMethods\nIn this multicenter, open-label trial, we randomly assigned 1818 patients with severe sepsis, in 100 intensive care units (ICUs), to receive either 20% albumin and crystalloid solution or crystalloid solution alone. In the albumin group, the target serum albumin concentration was 30 g per liter or more until discharge from the ICU or 28 days after randomization. The primary outcome was death from any cause at 28 days. Secondary outcomes were death from any cause at 90 days, the number of patients with organ dysfunction and the degree of dysfunction, and length of stay in the ICU and the hospital.\nResults\nDuring the first 7 days, patients in the albumin group, as compared with those in the crystalloid group, had a higher mean arterial pressure (P=0.03) and lower net fluid balance (P<0.001). The total daily amount of administered fluid did not differ significantly between the two groups (P=0.10). At 28 days, 285 of 895 patients (31.8%) in the albumin group and 288 of 900 (32.0%) in the crystalloid group had died (relative risk in the albumin group, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87 to 1.14; P=0.94). At 90 days, 365 of 888 patients (41.1%) in the albumin group and 389 of 893 (43.6%) in the crystalloid group had died (relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.05; P=0.29). No significant differences in other secondary outcomes were observed between the two groups.\nConclusions\nIn patients with severe sepsis, albumin replacement in addition to crystalloids, as compared with crystalloids alone, did not improve the rate of survival at 28 and 90 days. (Funded by the Italian Medicines Agency; ALBIOS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00707122.)\nFor decades, human albumin has been administered to patients to provide adequate oncotic pressure and intravascular volume.1 In 1998, however, a report from the Cochrane Injuries Group Albumin Reviewers indicated that the administration of albumin may be potentially harmful in critically ill patients, as compared with the administration of crystalloid solutions.2 Subsequent meta-analyses reported contradictory findings.3,4\nTo clarify this issue, a large, double-blind, randomized trial (the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation [SAFE] study)5 was conducted, in which 4% albumin solution was compared with normal saline as fluid replacement in critically ill patients, with results indicating that albumin administration was safe. A predefined subgroup analysis showed that patients with severe sepsis receiving albumin were at a lower, although not significantly lower, risk for death than those receiving normal saline. In addition, a subsequent study pointed out a potential benefit of maintaining serum albumin at a level of more than 30 g per liter in critically ill patients.6\nThere is a convincing rationale for the potential advantages of albumin administration during severe sepsis.7 Albumin is the main protein responsible for plasma colloid osmotic pressure8; it acts as a carrier for several endogenous and exogenous compounds,9 with antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties, and as a scavenger of reactive oxygen10,11 and nitrogen12 species and operates as a buffer molecule for acid–base equilibrium.13 We therefore conducted a randomized, controlled trial to investigate the effects of the administration of albumin and crystalloids, as compared with crystalloids alone, targeting a serum albumin level of 30 g per liter or more in a population of patients with severe sepsis.\nMethods\nStudy Oversight and Design\nWe conducted the Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis (ALBIOS) study — an investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial — in 100 intensive care units (ICUs) in Italy. The members of the steering committee (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) designed the study, were responsible for its execution and for the data analysis, made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication, and assume responsibility for the fidelity of the study to the protocol (available at NEJM.org).\nThe trial was funded by the Italian Medicines Agency, which had no role in the conduct of the study, the reporting of the data, or the supply of study fluids. Albumin administered during the study was provided by each participating institution as part of the clinical treatment of critically ill patients. The study protocol and the informed-consent process were approved by the ethics committee at each participating institution. Written informed consent or deferred consent was obtained from each patient.\nRandomization was performed centrally, with the use of a computer-generated and blinded assignment sequence. Randomization was stratified according to the participating ICU and the interval between the time that the patient met the clinical criteria for severe sepsis and randomization. The conduct of the trial was overseen by the data and safety monitoring board, which performed an interim analysis after the enrollment of 700 patients.\nPatients\nPatients 18 years of age or older who met the clinical criteria for severe sepsis14 within the previous 24 hours at any time during their stay in the ICU were enrolled in the study after being screened for eligibility criteria. Details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\nStudy Treatments\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive either 20% albumin and crystalloid"

However, the two groups did not differ significantly with respect to the number of patients given at least one open-label cisatracurium bolus during the entire ICU stay after enrollment (Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The required dose of sedatives or analgesics was similar in the two groups during the first week of the study (Table 9 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nSafety\nBradycardia developed during the cisatracurium infusion in one patient. No other side effects were reported.\nDiscussion\nTreatment with the neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium for 48 hours early in the course of severe ARDS improved the adjusted 90-day survival rate, increased the numbers of ventilator-free days and days outside the ICU, and decreased the incidence of barotrauma during the first 90 days. It did not significantly improve the overall 90-day mortality.\nStrengths of this trial include the methods used to minimize bias (blinded randomization assignments, a well-defined study protocol, complete follow-up, and intention-to-treat analyses). The recruitment of a large number of patients from 20 multidisciplinary ICUs where international standards of care are followed suggests that our data can be generalized to other ICUs.\nLimitations of the trial include the fact that our results were obtained for cisatracurium besylate and may not apply to other neuromuscular blocking agents. Furthermore, we did not assess the use of a neuromuscular blocking agent late in the course of ARDS or use on the basis of plateau-pressure or transpulmonary-pressure measurements.20 Another limitation is the absence of data on conditions known to antagonize or potentiate neuromuscular blockade. However, any condition that increases the duration of neuromuscular blockade would have adversely affected the patients receiving the neuromuscular blocking agent, in particular by increasing the duration of mechanical ventilation.\nThe sample-size calculation was based on our two previous studies performed in four ICUs13,15 that used the same inclusion criteria as were used in the current trial and on the European epidemiologic study ALIVE.4 However, the mortality in the placebo group in this study (40.7%) is lower than that in the control groups in the earlier studies. Given the observed mortality in our placebo group, the current study was underpowered. Indeed, 885 patients would have been needed to be enrolled to achieve 80% statistical power with a two-sided alpha value of 0.05.\nFinally, all our patients had severe ARDS. Additional work is needed to determine whether the use of neuromuscular blocking agents for only 24 hours is beneficial in selected patients. In our general analysis, which was prespecified but with post hoc determination of the threshold value for classifying subgroups, we found that the beneficial effect of the neuromuscular blocking agent on survival was confined to the two thirds of patients with a PaO2:FIO2 ratio below 120.\nThe mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of neuromuscular blocking agents remain speculative. A brief period of paralysis early in the course of ARDS may facilitate lung-protective mechanical ventilation by improving patient–ventilator synchrony and allowing for the accurate adjustment of tidal volume and pressure levels, thereby limiting the risk of both asynchrony-related alveolar collapse and regional alveolar-pressure increases with overdistention. Another possible mechanism of the benefit involves a decrease in lung or systemic inflammation.15\nThe main safety concern with the use of a neuromuscular blocking agent is muscle weakness; the risk varies among agents.21,22 Steroidal compounds (vecuronium, pancuronium, and rocuronium) may carry the highest risk of myopathy,23 although myopathy has also been reported with benzylisoquinolines, including cisatracurium besylate.24,25 Muscle weakness was not increased significantly by the use of the neuromuscular blocking agent in our study. The short duration of use of the neuromuscular blocking agent probably explains this result.\nIn conclusion, this multicenter trial provides evidence that the administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent early in the course of severe ARDS managed with low-tidal-volume ventilation may improve outcomes. Future studies are needed to replicate and expand these findings before they can be widely adopted in clinical practice.\n######################\nOutput:"

        "text": "were the same in the two groups.\nOpen-label cisatracurium was given more frequently in the placebo group than in the cisatracurium group during the first 48 hours after enrollment. However, the two groups did not differ significantly with respect to the number of patients given at least one open-label cisatracurium bolus during the entire ICU stay after enrollment (Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The required dose of sedatives or analgesics was similar in the two groups during the first week of the study (Table 9 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nSafety\nBradycardia developed during the cisatracurium infusion in one patient. No other side effects were reported.\nDiscussion\nTreatment with the neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium for 48 hours early in the course of severe ARDS improved the adjusted 90-day survival rate, increased the numbers of ventilator-free days and days outside the ICU, and decreased the incidence of barotrauma during the first 90 days. It did not significantly improve the overall 90-day mortality.\nStrengths of this trial include the methods used to minimize bias (blinded randomization assignments, a well-defined study protocol, complete follow-up, and intention-to-treat analyses). The recruitment of a large number of patients from 20 multidisciplinary ICUs where international standards of care are followed suggests that our data can be generalized to other ICUs.\nLimitations of the trial include the fact that our results were obtained for cisatracurium besylate and may not apply to other neuromuscular blocking agents. Furthermore, we did not assess the use of a neuromuscular blocking agent late in the course of ARDS or use on the basis of plateau-pressure or transpulmonary-pressure measurements.20 Another limitation is the absence of data on conditions known to antagonize or potentiate neuromuscular blockade. However, any condition that increases the duration of neuromuscular blockade would have adversely affected the patients receiving the neuromuscular blocking agent, in particular by increasing the duration of mechanical ventilation.\nThe sample-size calculation was based on our two previous studies performed in four ICUs13,15 that used the same inclusion criteria as were used in the current trial and on the European epidemiologic study ALIVE.4 However, the mortality in the placebo group in this study (40.7%) is lower than that in the control groups in the earlier studies. Given the observed mortality in our placebo group, the current study was underpowered. Indeed, 885 patients would have been needed to be enrolled to achieve 80% statistical power with a two-sided alpha value of 0.05.\nFinally, all our patients had severe ARDS. Additional work is needed to determine whether the use of neuromuscular blocking agents for only 24 hours is beneficial in selected patients. In our general analysis, which was prespecified but with post hoc determination of the threshold value for classifying subgroups, we found that the beneficial effect of the neuromuscular blocking agent on survival was confined to the two thirds of patients with a PaO2:FIO2 ratio below 120.\nThe mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of neuromuscular blocking agents remain speculative. A brief period of paralysis early in the course of ARDS may facilitate lung-protective mechanical ventilation by improving patient–ventilator synchrony and allowing for the accurate adjustment of tidal volume and pressure levels, thereby limiting the risk of both asynchrony-related alveolar collapse and regional alveolar-pressure increases with overdistention. Another possible mechanism of the benefit involves a decrease in lung or systemic inflammation.15\nThe main safety concern with the use of a neuromuscular blocking agent is muscle weakness; the risk varies among agents.21,22 Steroidal compounds (vecuronium, pancuronium, and rocuronium) may carry the highest risk of myopathy,23 although myopathy has also been reported with benzylisoquinolines, including cisatracurium besylate.24,25 Muscle weakness was not increased significantly by the use of the neuromuscular blocking agent in our study. The short duration of use of the neuromuscular blocking agent probably explains this result.\nIn conclusion, this multicenter trial provides evidence that the administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent early in the course of severe ARDS managed with low-tidal-volume ventilation may improve outcomes. Future studies are needed to replicate and expand these findings before they can be widely adopted in clinical practice."

We evaluated clinical outcomes after 2 days of therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with early, severe ARDS.\nMethods\nIn this multicenter, double-blind trial, 340 patients presenting to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an onset of severe ARDS within the previous 48 hours were randomly assigned to receive, for 48 hours, either cisatracurium besylate (178 patients) or placebo (162 patients). Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of less than 150, with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm or more of water and a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died either before hospital discharge or within 90 days after study enrollment (i.e., the 90-day in-hospital mortality rate), adjusted for predefined covariates and baseline differences between groups with the use of a Cox model.\nResults\nThe hazard ratio for death at 90 days in the cisatracurium group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.98; P=0.04), after adjustment for both the baseline PaO2:FIO2 and plateau pressure and the Simplified Acute Physiology II score. The crude 90-day mortality was 31.6% (95% CI, 25.2 to 38.8) in the cisatracurium group and 40.7% (95% CI, 33.5 to 48.4) in the placebo group (P=0.08). Mortality at 28 days was 23.7% (95% CI, 18.1 to 30.5) with cisatracurium and 33.3% (95% CI, 26.5 to 40.9) with placebo (P=0.05). The rate of ICU-acquired paresis did not differ significantly between the two groups.\nConclusions\nIn patients with severe ARDS, early administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent improved the adjusted 90-day survival and increased the time off the ventilator without increasing muscle weakness. (Funded by Assistance Publique–Hôpitaux de Marseille and the Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique Régional 2004-26 of the French Ministry of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00299650.)\nThe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by hypoxemic respiratory failure; it affects both medical and surgical patients.1 Despite rigorous physiological management,2 in most studies, ARDS has been fatal in 40 to 60% of patients.3–7\nNeuromuscular blocking agents are used in a large but highly variable proportion of patients with ARDS.8–12 Current guidelines indicate that neuromuscular blocking agents are appropriate for facilitating mechanical ventilation when sedation alone is inadequate, most notably in patients with severe gas-exchange impairments.10 In a four-center randomized, controlled trial of gas exchange in 56 patients with ARDS,13 infusion of a neuromuscular blocking agent for a period of 48 hours was associated with improved oxygenation and a trend toward lower mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) (46%, vs. 71% among patients who did not receive a blocking agent; P=0.06). However, this study was not designed or powered to evaluate mortality. Thus, the benefits and risks of adjunctive therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with ARDS who were receiving lung-protective mechanical ventilation14 require further evaluation.\nWe conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to determine whether a short period of treatment with the neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium besylate early in the course of severe ARDS would improve clinical outcomes.\nMethods\nPatients\nPatients were enrolled from March 2006 through March 2008 at 20 ICUs in France (see the Appendix). Eligibility criteria were the receipt of endotracheal mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and the presence of all of the following conditions for a period of no longer than 48 hours: ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2, measured in millimeters of mercury) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2, which is unitless) of less than 150 with the ventilator set to deliver a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm of water or higher and a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that were consistent with edema. An additional eligibility criterion was the absence of clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension — that is, a pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure, if available, of less than 18 mm Hg. If the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was not available, echocardiography was performed if the patient had a history of, or risk factors for, ischemic heart disease or had crackles on auscultation. Exclusion criteria are listed in Figure 1.\nFigure 1\n\nRandomization and Follow-up of the Patients, According to Study Group.\nThe trial was monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring board. Randomization and blinding regarding the study-group assignments were performed according to Consolidated Standards for the Reporting of Trials (CONSORT) guidelines, as indicated in the Supplementary Appendix\n######################\nOutput:"

        "text": "Abstract\nBackground\nIn patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), neuromuscular blocking agents may improve oxygenation and decrease ventilator-induced lung injury but may also cause muscle weakness. We evaluated clinical outcomes after 2 days of therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with early, severe ARDS.\nMethods\nIn this multicenter, double-blind trial, 340 patients presenting to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an onset of severe ARDS within the previous 48 hours were randomly assigned to receive, for 48 hours, either cisatracurium besylate (178 patients) or placebo (162 patients). Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of less than 150, with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm or more of water and a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died either before hospital discharge or within 90 days after study enrollment (i.e., the 90-day in-hospital mortality rate), adjusted for predefined covariates and baseline differences between groups with the use of a Cox model.\nResults\nThe hazard ratio for death at 90 days in the cisatracurium group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.98; P=0.04), after adjustment for both the baseline PaO2:FIO2 and plateau pressure and the Simplified Acute Physiology II score. The crude 90-day mortality was 31.6% (95% CI, 25.2 to 38.8) in the cisatracurium group and 40.7% (95% CI, 33.5 to 48.4) in the placebo group (P=0.08). Mortality at 28 days was 23.7% (95% CI, 18.1 to 30.5) with cisatracurium and 33.3% (95% CI, 26.5 to 40.9) with placebo (P=0.05). The rate of ICU-acquired paresis did not differ significantly between the two groups.\nConclusions\nIn patients with severe ARDS, early administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent improved the adjusted 90-day survival and increased the time off the ventilator without increasing muscle weakness. (Funded by Assistance Publique–Hôpitaux de Marseille and the Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique Régional 2004-26 of the French Ministry of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00299650.)\nThe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by hypoxemic respiratory failure; it affects both medical and surgical patients.1 Despite rigorous physiological management,2 in most studies, ARDS has been fatal in 40 to 60% of patients.3–7\nNeuromuscular blocking agents are used in a large but highly variable proportion of patients with ARDS.8–12 Current guidelines indicate that neuromuscular blocking agents are appropriate for facilitating mechanical ventilation when sedation alone is inadequate, most notably in patients with severe gas-exchange impairments.10 In a four-center randomized, controlled trial of gas exchange in 56 patients with ARDS,13 infusion of a neuromuscular blocking agent for a period of 48 hours was associated with improved oxygenation and a trend toward lower mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) (46%, vs. 71% among patients who did not receive a blocking agent; P=0.06). However, this study was not designed or powered to evaluate mortality. Thus, the benefits and risks of adjunctive therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with ARDS who were receiving lung-protective mechanical ventilation14 require further evaluation.\nWe conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to determine whether a short period of treatment with the neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium besylate early in the course of severe ARDS would improve clinical outcomes.\nMethods\nPatients\nPatients were enrolled from March 2006 through March 2008 at 20 ICUs in France (see the Appendix). Eligibility criteria were the receipt of endotracheal mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and the presence of all of the following conditions for a period of no longer than 48 hours: ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2, measured in millimeters of mercury) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2, which is unitless) of less than 150 with the ventilator set to deliver a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm of water or higher and a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that were consistent with edema. An additional eligibility criterion was the absence of clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension — that is, a pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure, if available, of less than 18 mm Hg. If the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was not available, echocardiography was performed if the patient had a history of, or risk factors for, ischemic heart disease or had crackles on auscultation. Exclusion criteria are listed in Figure 1.\nFigure 1\n\nRandomization and Follow-up of the Patients, According to Study Group.\nThe trial was monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring board. Randomization and blinding regarding the study-group assignments were performed according to Consolidated Standards for the Reporting of Trials (CONSORT) guidelines, as indicated in the Supplementary Appendix"

However, the benefits and harms of different hemoglobin thresholds for transfusion have not been established.\nMethods\nIn this multicenter, parallel-group trial, we randomly assigned patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who had septic shock and a hemoglobin concentration of 9 g per deciliter or less to receive 1 unit of leukoreduced red cells when the hemoglobin level was 7 g per deciliter or less (lower threshold) or when the level was 9 g per deciliter or less (higher threshold) during the ICU stay. The primary outcome measure was death by 90 days after randomization.\nResults\nWe analyzed data from 998 of 1005 patients (99.3%) who underwent randomization. The two intervention groups had similar baseline characteristics. In the ICU, the lower-threshold group received a median of 1 unit of blood (interquartile range, 0 to 3) and the higher-threshold group received a median of 4 units (interquartile range, 2 to 7). At 90 days after randomization, 216 of 502 patients (43.0%) assigned to the lower-threshold group, as compared with 223 of 496 (45.0%) assigned to the higher-threshold group, had died (relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.09; P=0.44). The results were similar in analyses adjusted for risk factors at baseline and in analyses of the per-protocol populations. The numbers of patients who had ischemic events, who had severe adverse reactions, and who required life support were similar in the two intervention groups.\nConclusions\nAmong patients with septic shock, mortality at 90 days and rates of ischemic events and use of life support were similar among those assigned to blood transfusion at a higher hemoglobin threshold and those assigned to blood transfusion at a lower threshold; the latter group received fewer transfusions. (Funded by the Danish Strategic Research Council and others; TRISS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01485315.)\nBlood transfusions are frequently given to patients with septic shock.1–4 Some of these transfusions are given to patients who are bleeding, but many nonbleeding patients also undergo transfusion.5\nThe recommendations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign regarding blood transfusion in patients with septic shock are complex and include a recommendation for transfusion to maintain a hematocrit of more than 30% in the presence of hypoperfusion in the first 6 hours. 6 After that, the transfusion threshold should be a hemoglobin level of less than 7 g per deciliter, aiming at levels between 7 g and 9 g per deciliter in patients who do not have myocardial ischemia, severe hypoxemia, acute hemorrhage, or ischemic coronary artery disease.6 However, there are limited data supporting these recommendations,6 and many clinicians may not follow them.4,7 New trial data have been published recently,8 and the use of a high hemoglobin threshold for transfusion may be at least questioned as part of an early resuscitation protocol for patients with septic shock.\nBlood transfusion has been associated with increased mortality in subgroups of critically ill patients, both in cohort studies and in randomized trials,9–12 but there have also been cohort studies in which transfusion was associated with improved survival,13 including among patients with sepsis.14 In some studies, nonleukoreduced blood was used, which may have influenced the results. Given the lack of efficacy data, in addition to concerns about safety, we conducted the Transfusion Requirements in Septic Shock (TRISS) trial to evaluate the effects on mortality of leukoreduced blood transfusion at a lower versus a higher hemoglobin threshold among patients with septic shock who are in the intensive care unit (ICU).\nMethods\nTrial Design and Oversight\nAfter the approvals from ethics committees and data-protection agencies were obtained, patients in 32 general ICUs in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland underwent screening and randomization between December 3, 2011, and December 26, 2013. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients or their legal surrogates before or after enrollment. In all cases, consent was obtained from the patient when possible. If consent was withdrawn or not granted, we asked the patient or surrogate for permission to continue registration of trial data and to use these data in the analyses. The protocol, including details regarding trial conduct and the statistical analysis plan, has been published previously15 and is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The management committee (see the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org) designed the trial and vouches for the adherence of the study to the protocol and for the accuracy of the data and the analyses. The members of the management committee wrote the drafts of the manuscript and made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The funders had no role in the design of the protocol, the trial conduct, or the analyses or reporting of the data.\nThis trial was a multicenter, stratified, parallel-group, clinical trial. Randomization was performed with the use of a centralized computer-generated assignment sequence, with stratification according to study site and the presence or absence of active hematologic cancer, because these characteristics may influence outcome.16,17 Patients with septic shock were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, with the use of permuted blocks of varying sizes of 6, 8, or 10, to blood transfusion at the higher hemoglobin threshold or the lower hemoglobin threshold. Treatment assignments were concealed from the investigators assessing mortality\n######################\nOutput:"

At 90 days after randomization, 216 of 502 patients (43.0%) assigned to the lower-threshold group, as compared with 223 of 496 (45.0%) assigned to the higher-threshold group, had died (relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.09; P=0.44). The results were similar in analyses adjusted for risk factors at baseline and in analyses of the per-protocol populations. The numbers of patients who had ischemic events, who had severe adverse reactions, and who required life support were similar in the two intervention groups.\nConclusions\nAmong patients with septic shock, mortality at 90 days and rates of ischemic events and use of life support were similar among those assigned to blood transfusion at a higher hemoglobin threshold and those assigned to blood transfusion at a lower threshold; the latter group received fewer transfusions. (Funded by the Danish Strategic Research Council and others; TRISS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01485315.)\nBlood transfusions are frequently given to patients with septic shock.1–4 Some of these transfusions are given to patients who are bleeding, but many nonbleeding patients also undergo transfusion.5\nThe recommendations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign regarding blood transfusion in patients with septic shock are complex and include a recommendation for transfusion to maintain a hematocrit of more than 30% in the presence of hypoperfusion in the first 6 hours. 6 After that, the transfusion threshold should be a hemoglobin level of less than 7 g per deciliter, aiming at levels between 7 g and 9 g per deciliter in patients who do not have myocardial ischemia, severe hypoxemia, acute hemorrhage, or ischemic coronary artery disease.6 However, there are limited data supporting these recommendations,6 and many clinicians may not follow them.4,7 New trial data have been published recently,8 and the use of a high hemoglobin threshold for transfusion may be at least questioned as part of an early resuscitation protocol for patients with septic shock.\nBlood transfusion has been associated with increased mortality in subgroups of critically ill patients, both in cohort studies and in randomized trials,9–12 but there have also been cohort studies in which transfusion was associated with improved survival,13 including among patients with sepsis.14 In some studies, nonleukoreduced blood was used, which may have influenced the results. Given the lack of efficacy data, in addition to concerns about safety, we conducted the Transfusion Requirements in Septic Shock (TRISS) trial to evaluate the effects on mortality of leukoreduced blood transfusion at a lower versus a higher hemoglobin threshold among patients with septic shock who are in the intensive care unit (ICU).\nMethods\nTrial Design and Oversight\nAfter the approvals from ethics committees and data-protection agencies were obtained, patients in 32 general ICUs in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland underwent screening and randomization between December 3, 2011, and December 26, 2013. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients or their legal surrogates before or after enrollment. In all cases, consent was obtained from the patient when possible. If consent was withdrawn or not granted, we asked the patient or surrogate for permission to continue registration of trial data and to use these data in the analyses. The protocol, including details regarding trial conduct and the statistical analysis plan, has been published previously15 and is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The management committee (see the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org) designed the trial and vouches for the adherence of the study to the protocol and for the accuracy of the data and the analyses. The members of the management committee wrote the drafts of the manuscript and made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The funders had no role in the design of the protocol, the trial conduct, or the analyses or reporting of the data.\nThis trial was a multicenter, stratified, parallel-group, clinical trial. Randomization was performed with the use of a centralized computer-generated assignment sequence, with stratification according to study site and the presence or absence of active hematologic cancer, because these characteristics may influence outcome.16,17 Patients with septic shock were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, with the use of permuted blocks of varying sizes of 6, 8, or 10, to blood transfusion at the higher hemoglobin threshold or the lower hemoglobin threshold. Treatment assignments were concealed from the investigators assessing mortality"

One patient had a serious adverse reaction to transfusion (Table 2, and Table S13 in the Supplementary Appendix). The use of life support at days 5, 14, and 28 was similar in the two intervention groups (Table 2, and Tables S11 and S13 in the Supplementary Appendix), as were the percentages of days alive without vasopressor or inotropic therapy, without mechanical ventilation, and without renal-replacement therapy and the percentage of days alive and out of the hospital (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nIn this international, multicenter, partially blinded, randomized trial involving patients with septic shock who were in the ICU, we observed no significant differences in mortality at 90 days, in the numbers of patients with ischemic events or with severe adverse reactions, in the use of life support, or in the numbers of days alive and out of the hospital between the group of patients who underwent transfusion at a lower hemoglobin threshold and the group of those who underwent transfusion at a higher hemoglobin threshold. Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with chronic cardiovascular disease, with older age, or with greater disease severity. The patients in the lower-threshold group received 50% fewer units of blood than those in the higher-threshold group, and 36% of the patients in the lower-threshold group did not undergo transfusion in the ICU, as compared with 1% of the patients in the higher-threshold group.\nOur results are consistent with those obtained in the TRICC trial, which assessed a lower versus higher hemoglobin threshold for blood transfusion in a broad population of adult patients in the ICU.9 In that trial, there were no significant differences in mortality at 30 days in the full trial population (the primary outcome) or among patients 55 years of age or older or those with more severe disease; these two subgroups may best resemble our patients. Our results are also in line with those of a large trial involving high-risk patients after hip surgery, the Transfusion Trigger Trial for Functional Outcomes in Cardiovascular Patients Undergoing Surgical Hip Fracture Repair (FOCUS) trial,27 and the Cochrane meta-analysis of trials of transfusion thresholds, both of which support restrictive transfusion to reduce the use of blood in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease.28 An important exception is patients with acute myocardial infarction, who were excluded both from our trial and from the FOCUS trial.27 Research is needed to assess the safety of lower hemoglobin thresholds for transfusion in these patients.12\nThe effect of transfusion thresholds on rates of myocardial infarction may have differed among the three trials. In the TRICC trial, significantly increased rates of myocardial infarction were observed with a higher transfusion threshold,9 whereas the opposite was observed in the FOCUS trial and in our trial, although the numerical differences were not significant in either of these two trials.27 In our trial, myocardial infarction was not a prespecified outcome measure (the data are provided in the Supplementary Appendix); we did not specify surveillance testing for myocardial ischemia in the protocol and may have missed some events. This may also have resulted in detection bias because the clinicians and investigators were not unaware of the intervention assignments.\nWe observed no harm with an excess transfusion of a median of 3 units of blood, a finding that is contrary to most of the observational data regarding transfusion in critically ill patients.10 Whether this was due to the use of leukoreduced blood cannot be assessed, but results similar to ours were observed in the FOCUS trial, in which the majority of patients also received leukoreduced blood.27 The safety of leukoreduced blood was challenged by the results of a trial involving patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which showed increased mortality with liberal transfusion of this product.11 Ongoing bleeding may have contributed to the increased mortality observed with liberal transfusion in that trial.11 Thus the effects of leukoreduction on outcome are unclear, as they were a decade ago, as indicated in a 2004 meta-analysis of trial data on leukoreduced versus nonleukoreduced blood.29\nThe strengths of our trial include a low risk of bias, because group assignment at randomization was concealed, and the blinding of the assessors of mortality and the statistician to the assigned intervention. It is reasonable to assume that our results are generalizable, because patients were recruited both in university hospitals and in nonuniversity hospitals, and the majority of patients who underwent screening were included. The trial protocol was pragmatic, so routine practice was maintained except for the hemoglobin thresholds for transfusion. In addition, the characteristics of the patients and the outcome rates were similar to those observed in some recent trials involving patients with septic shock in the ICU.3,19,30,31\nOur trial has limitations. First, the investigators, clinicians, and patients were aware of the study-group assignments, and we did not assess all the cointerventions. Because the trial was multicenter and large and used stratified randomization, it is unlikely that imbalance in concomitant interventions affected the results. Second, the confidence interval was relatively wide for the point estimate for mortality, so we cannot exclude a 9% relative increase or a 22% relative decrease in mortality at 90 days in the lower-threshold group versus\n######################\nOutput:"

In addition, the characteristics of the patients and the outcome rates were similar to those observed in some recent trials involving patients with septic shock in the ICU.3,19,30,31\nOur trial has limitations. First, the investigators, clinicians, and patients were aware of the study-group assignments, and we did not assess all the cointerventions. Because the trial was multicenter and large and used stratified randomization, it is unlikely that imbalance in concomitant interventions affected the results. Second, the confidence interval was relatively wide for the point estimate for mortality, so we cannot exclude a 9% relative increase or a 22% relative decrease in mortality at 90 days in the lower-threshold group versus"

Details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\nStudy Treatments\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive either 20% albumin and crystalloid solution (albumin group) or crystalloid solution alone (crystalloid group) from randomization until day 28 or discharge from the ICU, whichever came first. During the early phase of volume resuscitation, fluids were administered in both groups according to early goal-directed therapy.15\nAfter randomization, patients in the albumin group received 300 ml of 20% albumin solution. From day 1 until day 28 or ICU discharge (whichever came first), 20% albumin was administered on a daily basis, to maintain a serum albumin level of 30 g per liter or more. In both groups, crystalloids were administered whenever it was clinically indicated by the attending physician. The administration of synthetic colloids was not allowed. All other treatments were at the discretion of the attending physician.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome measure was death from any cause at 28 days after randomization. The principal secondary outcome measure was death from any cause at 90 days after randomization. Additional secondary outcomes were the number of patients with organ dysfunction and the degree of dysfunction and the length of stay in the ICU and the hospital. The severity of systemic illness was assessed with the use of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score, with scores ranging from 0 to 163 and higher scores indicating more severe illness.16 Organ function was assessed daily with the use of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score,17 which ranges from 0 to 4 for each of five components (respiratory, coagulation, liver, cardiovascular, and renal components), with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). New organ failures were defined as a change in a component score during the study from a baseline score of 0, 1, or 2 to a score of 3 or 4.5,18,19 Tertiary outcomes, which were assessed in post hoc analyses, included the use of renal-replacement therapy, the incidence of acute kidney injury, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the time to suspension of the administration of vasopressor or inotropic agents.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe originally determined that a sample of 1350 patients would provide the study with 80% power to detect an absolute between-group difference of 7.5 percentage points in mortality at 28 days, on the basis of an estimated baseline mortality of 45%, with a two-sided P value of less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance. The study protocol specified the possibility of increasing the sample to 1800 patients on the basis of a recommendation by the data and safety monitoring board during an interim analysis.\nAll the analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Binary outcomes were compared with the use of the chi-square test, and continuous outcomes with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Comparisons of fluid volumes and physiological data over time were performed with the use of a two-factor analysis of variance for repeated measurements. We calculated survival estimates according to the Kaplan–Meier method and compared them using a log-rank test. We performed an adjusted analysis using robust Poisson regression for binary outcomes. In a post hoc analysis, the primary and principal secondary outcomes were assessed in patients who had septic shock and those who did not have septic shock at the time of enrollment. Heterogeneity of treatment effects among subgroups was assessed with the use of the test for a common relative risk. SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute), was used for all the analyses.\nResults\nStudy Population\nFrom August 2008 through February 2012, a total of 1818 patients with severe sepsis were randomly assigned to receive 20% albumin and crystalloid solution (910 patients) or crystalloid solution alone (908) for fluid replacement. Per protocol, patient enrollment was stratified according to the interval between the time the patient met the clinical criteria for severe sepsis and randomization: 6 hours or less (579 patients [31.8%]) versus more than 6 hours (1239 [68.2%]). A total of 8 patients were excluded from the analysis (2 patients in the albumin group owing to withdrawal of consent, and 5 in the albumin group and 1 in the crystalloid group owing to a randomization error) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nAfter follow-up, data regarding death at 90 days were available for 888 of 903 patients (98.3%) in the albumin group and for 893 of 907 (98.5%) in the crystalloid group. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two study groups, except for a slight imbalance in the number of patients with organ dysfunction and values of central venous oxygen saturation (Table 1). The primary site of infection, the type of identified microorganism, and the proportion of patients receiving antibiotics were similar in the two groups (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\nFluid Therapy and Treatment Effects\nDuring the first 7 days, the albumin group, as compared with the crystalloid group, received a significantly larger volume of 20% albumin solution (P<0.001) and less crystalloid solution (P<0.001).

In the albumin group, the administration of 20% albumin solution accounted for a median daily average of 4.3% (interquartile range, 2.9 to 5.8) of the total administered fluids. The total daily amount of administered fluids in the first 7 days did not differ significantly between the albumin group and the crystalloid group (3738 ml [interquartile range, 3174 to 4437] and 3825 ml [interquartile range, 3205 to 4533], respectively; P=0.10) (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nThe serum albumin level was significantly higher in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group from day 1 to day 28 (P<0.001) (Figure 1A). During the first 7 days, patients in the albumin group had a significantly lower heart rate than those in the crystalloid group (P=0.002), as well as a significantly higher mean arterial pressure (P=0.03) (Table S4 and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Daily net fluid balances were lower in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group (P<0.001) (Figure 1B). The median cumulative net fluid balance was also significantly lower in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group (347 ml [interquartile range, −3266 to 4042] vs. 1220 ml [interquartile range, −2767 to 5034], P=0.004) (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 1\n\nSerum Albumin Levels through Day 28 and Net Fluid Balance through Day 7.\nOutcomes\nAt 28 days after randomization, 285 of 895 patients (31.8%) in the albumin group and 288 of 900 (32.0%) in the crystalloid group had died (relative risk in the albumin group, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87 to 1.14; P=0.94) (Table 2). At 90 days of follow-up, 365 of 888 patients (41.1%) in the albumin group and 389 of 893 (43.6%) in the crystalloid group had died (relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.05; P=0.29). No significant difference in the probability of survival was observed between the albumin group and the crystalloid group during the 90 days after randomization (P=0.39) (Figure 2).\nFigure 2\n\nProbability of Survival from Randomization through Day 90.\nTable 2\n\nOutcomes.\nNo significant difference was observed between the two study groups with respect to either the number of newly developed organ failures or the median SOFA score (Table 2). Analysis of the SOFA score for each organ system revealed that, as compared with the crystalloid group, the albumin group had a lower cardiovascular score (P=0.03), a higher coagulation score (P=0.04), and a higher liver score (P=0.02). No significant differences were observed in other secondary and tertiary outcomes, with the exception of the time to suspension of the administration of vasopressor or inotropic agents, which was shorter in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group (P=0.007) (Table 2).\nIn subgroup analyses, no significant difference was observed in the prespecified subgroups that were stratified according to the interval between the time the patient met the clinical criteria for severe sepsis and randomization (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Conversely, a significant difference was observed in a post hoc subgroup analysis that included 1121 patients with septic shock, as compared with 660 without septic shock, at the time of enrollment (relative risk with septic shock, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.99; relative risk without septic shock, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.39; P=0.03 for heterogeneity) (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Adjustment for baseline covariates did not significantly modify these results (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nDiscussion\nThe main results of this large-scale trial provide evidence regarding both the efficacy and the safety of the use of human albumin during severe sepsis — an interventional strategy that has long been debated.21,22 The addition of albumin to crystalloids during the first 28 days of treatment to maintain a serum albumin level of 30 g per liter or more is safe but does not provide a survival advantage over crystalloids alone, over a follow-up period of 90 days. Similar findings were observed in the subgroup stratified according to the interval between the time the patient met the clinical criteria for severe sepsis and treatment application.\nThe findings in our trial may appear to contradict those of the predefined subgroup analysis from the SAFE study,5 which suggested a survival advantage with an albumin-based strategy during severe sepsis. The plausibility of this hypothesis was supported by the significant hemodynamic advantages observed23 and\n######################\nOutput:"

Similar findings were observed in the subgroup stratified according to the interval between the time the patient met the clinical criteria for severe sepsis and treatment application.\nThe findings in our trial may appear to contradict those of the predefined subgroup analysis from the SAFE study,5 which suggested a survival advantage with an albumin-based strategy during severe sepsis. The plausibility of this hypothesis was supported by the significant hemodynamic advantages observed23 and by further investigations showing that the correction of hypoalbuminemia reduced the severity of organ dysfunction.4,6 Similar beneficial effects were also suggested by a large meta-analysis, which concluded that the use of albumin-containing solutions could be associated with lower mortality than that seen with other fluid regimens.24\nOur results confirm that administration of albumin produces small but significant hemodynamic advantages. A significantly greater proportion of patients in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group reached the targeted mean arterial pressure within 6 hours after randomization (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). During the first 7 days, the mean arterial pressure was higher, whereas the heart rate and net fluid balance were lower, in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group. Moreover, the average cardiovascular SOFA subscore over the course of the study period was lower in the albumin group, and the time to the suspension of inotropic or vasopressor agents was shorter, indicating a decreased use of vasopressors. These effects were obtained with similar amounts of administered fluids in the two study groups. These findings confirm a physiological advantage of albumin administration during severe sepsis, including a larger fluid distribution within the intravascular compartment and, in addition, possible effects of albumin as a scavenger of nitric oxide,12 mediating peripheral vasodilatation during sepsis.25,26\nThe secondary outcomes also provide a detailed profile of the safety of albumin administration during severe sepsis. The incidence of new organ failures during the study was similar in the two groups. We observed slightly higher average SOFA subscores for liver and coagulation in the albumin group, indicating a higher serum bilirubin and a lower platelet count, respectively, than were observed in the crystalloid group. Nonetheless, the absolute excess in the serum bilirubin concentration in the albumin group was marginal (median, 1.0 mg per deciliter [interquartile range, 0.6 to 1.7] vs. 0.9 mg per deciliter [interquartile range, 0.5 to 1.5], P<0.001) and was probably related to the methods used to prepare albumin solutions, which may be inefficient in clearing bilirubin content from plasma.21,27 The slight reduction in platelet counts in the albumin group may be a further marker of a larger expansion of the intravascular compartment in this group than in the crystalloid group, with a consequent dilution of the hemoglobin content (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nPost hoc univariate and multivariate analyses of data from the 1121 patients with septic shock showed significantly lower mortality at 90 days in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group. Conversely, in the subgroup of patients with severe sepsis without shock, mortality appeared to be higher among those who were treated with albumin than among those treated with crystalloids alone, although the difference was far from significant. This analysis was not prespecified, and therefore it may be characterized by well-known biases. Nonetheless, a state of shock associated with severe sepsis represents a well-defined clinical entity. Moreover, if the oncotic, antiinflammatory, and nitric oxide–scavenging properties of albumin are of clinical importance, these may be maximally exploited in the conditions that are the most severe, such as cardiovascular dysfunction.\nOur trial has certain limitations. First, we included the use of albumin solutions with a greater concentration than those used in the SAFE study (20% vs. 4%). Consequently, the volume of albumin solution that was administered was markedly lower than that administered in the SAFE study, since our goal was to correct hypoalbuminemia and not to directly replace intravascular volume. Second, the observed mortality at 28 days was lower than originally expected, thereby increasing the likelihood that the study was underpowered. Finally, only approximately one third of the patients were enrolled during the early phase of severe sepsis.\nIn conclusion, the use of albumin in addition to crystalloids to correct hypoalbuminemia, as compared with the use of crystalloids alone, in patients with severe sepsis during their stay in the ICU did not provide a survival benefit at 28 or 90 days, despite improvements in hemodynamic variables. The clinical benefit of albumin that was seen in the post hoc analysis of the subgroup of patients with septic shock warrants further confirmation.\n######################\nOutput:"

Muscle strength was evaluated with the use of the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, a previously validated scale that assesses three muscle groups in each arm and leg. The score for each muscle group can range from 0 (paralysis) to 5 (normal strength), with the overall score ranging from 0 to 60.17 The definition of ICU-acquired paresis was an MRC score of less than 48.17\nStudy Outcomes\nPrimary Outcome\nThe primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died before hospital discharge and within 90 days after study enrollment (the 90-day mortality). Patients who were outside the hospital (including those in other types of health care facilities) and who were able to breathe spontaneously at day 90 were considered to have been discharged home. Because we anticipated that there would be an imbalance in at least one key risk factor at baseline, the primary outcome was derived from a Cox regression model in which we adjusted for such imbalance. We also report the crude mortality at day 90.\nSecondary Outcomes\nSecondary outcomes were the day-28 mortality, the numbers of days outside the ICU between day 1 and day 28 and between day 1 and day 90, the number of days without organ or system failure between day 1 and day 28, the rate of barotrauma, the rate of ICU-acquired paresis, the MRC scores on day 28 and at the time of ICU discharge, and the numbers of ventilator-free days (days since successful weaning from mechanical ventilation) between day 1 and day 28 and between day 1 and day 90. It was required that the patient breathe spontaneously, without the aid of a ventilator, for a period of at least 48 hours for weaning from the ventilator to be considered successful. The number of ventilator-free days was considered to be zero for patients who were weaned from mechanical ventilation but who died before day 28 or day 90.18\nStatistical Analysis\nAssumptions for the sample-size calculation were based on our previous studies13,15 that used the same inclusion criteria and on the European epidemiologic study Acute Lung Injury Verification (ALIVE).4 Assuming a 50% mortality at 90 days in the placebo group, we calculated that 340 patients would need to be enrolled to detect a 15% absolute reduction in the 90-day mortality in the cisatracurium group as compared with the placebo group, with 80% statistical power and a two-sided alpha value of 0.05. No interim analysis was performed.\nWe assessed the differences between the groups using Student's t-test, the Wilcoxon test, the chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. All reported P values are two-sided and have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons. Kaplan–Meier curves were plotted to assess the time from enrollment to death and the time to disconnection from the ventilator for a period of at least 48 hours.\nThe primary analysis consisted of evaluating the effect of cisatracurium on the primary outcome (i.e., 90-day mortality), with adjustment by means of a Cox multivariate proportional-hazards model that included two predefined covariates: the baseline Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II and the baseline plateau pressure.19 SAPS II is calculated from 12 physiological measurements during a 24-hour period, information about previous health status, and some information obtained at admission. This score ranges from 0 to 163, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. We planned to include all the variables for which there was an imbalance between the two groups at baseline, but the only imbalanced variable was the PaO2:FIO2 ratio. Therefore, we also conducted an analysis based on the baseline PaO2:FIO2 ratio, in which the two thirds of patients with a ratio below 120 (indicating hypoxemia) were compared with the third with a higher ratio. A total of 12 secondary analyses of prespecified outcomes were performed, and results of 9 of these are reported. Only one post hoc analysis was conducted; the results are reported.\nResults\nBaseline Characteristics\nWe enrolled 340 patients, of whom 178 were randomly assigned to cisatracurium and 162 to placebo. We excluded 986 patients (Figure 1). One patient in the cisatracurium group withdrew consent before treatment was started, and data for this patient were therefore not included in the analysis. The median time from the diagnosis of ARDS to study inclusion was 16 hours (interquartile range, 6 to 29) in the study population and did not differ significantly between the cisatracurium group (median, 18 hours; interquartile range, 6 to 31) and the placebo group (median, 15 hours; interquartile range, 7 to 27; P=0.45). The median time from initiation of mechanical ventilation to study inclusion did not differ significantly between the cisatracurium group (22 hours; interquartile range, 9 to 41) and the placebo group (21 hours; interquartile range, 10 to 42; P=0.91). The only significant difference between the two groups at baseline was a lower mean PaO2:FIO2 value in the cisatracurium group (P=0.03) (Table 2, and Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 2\n\nBaseline Characteristics of the Patients, According to Study Group.\nOutcomes\nPrimary Outcome\nThe Cox regression model yielded a hazard ratio for death at 90 days in the cis\n######################\nOutput:"

At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 46 patients (40%) in the placebo group and in 65 patients (57%) in the corticosteroid group.\n\nResponders\nThe median time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal was 7 days in the placebo group and 9 days in the corticosteroid group. The proportionality assumption was not supported for the Cox model and comparison of time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal distributions was performed using a log-rank test (P = .49, Figure 3B). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 18 patients (53%) in the placebo group and in 18 patients (50%) in the corticosteroid group.\n\nAll Patients\nThe median time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal was 9 days in the placebo group and 7 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 1.54 (95% CI, 1.10-2.16; P = .01; Figure 3C). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 64 patients (43%) in the placebo group and in 83 patients (55%) in the corticosteroid group.\n\nAdverse Events\nThere were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the rates of adverse events possibly related to corticosteroids or vasopressors, or related to ICU invasive procedures (Table 5).\n\nComment\nWe found that a 7-day replacement therapy with hydrocortisone (50 mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours) and fludrocortisone (50 µg tablet once daily) significantly reduced 28-day mortality and duration of vasopressor administration in all patients with septic shock, in particular those with relative adrenal insufficiency. In addition, among the latter, corticosteroid therapy significantly reduced mortality during both ICU and hospital stays, and tended to reduce 1-year mortality. Our results indicate that, in this population, 1 additional life could be saved at day 28 for every 7 patients treated with corticosteroids. Replacement therapy had no significant effect on the same variables in patients who had septic shock without relative adrenal insufficiency. If the power to detect differences in responders was lower than that in nonresponders due to the lower proportion of responders, it should be observed that no tendency toward efficacy (or deleterious effect) was observed in responders for any of the above mentioned variables. These results confirm the hypothesis on which the study was planned that patients with septic shock with relative adrenal insufficiency could benefit from replacement therapy.\n\nOur results are consistent with a study of healthy volunteers challenged with endotoxin27 and with 2 studies of patients with septic shock,12,13 that showed that low doses of hydrocortisone can restore vascular responsiveness to catecholamines. Our results are also consistent with those of 2 small trials showing that replacement therapy with hydrocortisone reduces the time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal in septic shock.14,15 Finally, our study establishes that a short corticotropin test performed at early onset of septic shock is useful for identifying patients that could most benefit from replacement therapy with corticosteroids. However, it has to be stressed that the time required to obtain the results largely depends on the method used to measure cortisol (eg, enzymatic method, radioimmunoassay) and therefore that treatment should be started as soon as the test has been completed.\n\nThe sample size was calculated to detect a difference of 20% between the 2 groups of nonresponders on the 28-day mortality rate using a 1-sided formulation. Such a formulation was chosen because the preliminary reports that were available at the planning phase of the study22,23 had shown that for several days patients tolerated well 200 to 300 mg of hydrocortisone daily, and we had no interest in formally demonstrating a hypothetical deleterious effect of corticosteroids. However, as recommended by the 9th International Conference on Harmonization, at the time of analysis, all tests were performed using a 2-sided formulation and all reported P values were 2-sided. The sample size was also computed based on the assumptions of a mortality rate of 95% in the nonresponder placebo subgroup and a frequency of nonresponders of 40% in the population of patients with septic shock. In fact, the mortality rate in the nonresponder placebo subgroup (63%) was much lower than expected compared with the reports that were available at the planning phase of the study7,22 and with the hypothesis that patients with adrenal insufficiency would very likely die without hormone replacement. Conversely, the proportion of nonresponders (77%) was much higher than expected and the resulting increase in the sample size of nonresponders (from 108 to 229) may have favored the detection of a lower difference (10%) than expected between the 2 groups.\n\nSeveral differences between the design of this positive study and previous negative studies28-33 deserve comment. First, our trial was focused on a very specific population who were presumed to benefit from corticosteroids because of relative adrenal insufficiency. Second, low doses of a combination of the natural hormone hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were used (as recommended to treat adrenal insufficiency)16 rather than high doses of a synthetic glucocorticoid compound. The addition of fludrocortisone to hydrocortisone was justified because primary adrenal insufficiency\n######################\nOutput:"

The primary outcome was ICU-free days (days alive and free from the need for intensive care) from randomization to day 28.\nResults\nThe number of ICU-free days to day 28 did not differ significantly between the acetaminophen group and the placebo group: 23 days (interquartile range, 13 to 25) among patients assigned to acetaminophen and 22 days (interquartile range, 12 to 25) among patients assigned to placebo (Hodges–Lehmann estimate of absolute difference, 0 days; 96.2% confidence interval [CI], 0 to 1; P=0.07). A total of 55 of 345 patients in the acetaminophen group (15.9%) and 57 of 344 patients in the placebo group (16.6%) had died by day 90 (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.39; P=0.84).\nConclusions\nEarly administration of acetaminophen to treat fever due to probable infection did not affect the number of ICU-free days. (Funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand and others; HEAT Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number, ACTRN12612000513819.)\nAdministration of acetaminophen to lower temperature in patients with fever and probable infection is a frequent intervention in the community and in hospitals. In the intensive care unit (ICU), such treatment is common1,2 and is based on the rationale that fever places additional physiological stress on patients who are already seriously ill.3 Treatment of fever in ICU patients with infection is supported by a recent randomized, controlled trial in which physical cooling of mechanically ventilated patients with septic shock to a normal body temperature was associated with a reduction in vasopressor dose and reduced early mortality.4\nThe common practice of treating fever in patients with infection is challenged by studies showing that fever may enhance immune-cell function,5 inhibit pathogen growth,6–8 and increase the activity of antimicrobial drugs9 and by observational studies showing that higher early fever is associated with a lower risk of death among patients with an ICU admission diagnosis of infection.10,11\nThe lack of high-level evidence12 leaves ICU clinicians uncertain about whether acetaminophen treatment of fever due to probable infection is beneficial, ineffective, or harmful. To address this uncertainty, we conducted a multicenter, blinded, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the hypothesis that administration of intravenous acetaminophen to treat fever would worsen outcomes. Specifically, we hypothesized that, as compared with placebo, acetaminophen would result in fewer ICU-free days (days alive and free from the need for intensive care) in adult ICU patients with fever and probable infection.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nWe conducted an investigator-initiated, prospective, parallel-group, blinded, randomized, controlled trial. The management committee (made up of all the authors) designed the trial, which was endorsed by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Clinical Trials Group. The George Institute for Global Health (Sydney) and the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand (Wellington) provided subsidized project management and on-site monitoring of data quality for this study. The protocol, which was reported before enrollment commenced13 and is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, was approved by the New Zealand Multi-region Ethics Committee and by each participating institution. Written informed consent before randomization or delayed consent was obtained from each patient or a legal surrogate, unless an institutional ethics committee approved a waiver of consent (e.g., in the event that a patient died before informed consent could be obtained from a surrogate decision maker). The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses and for the fidelity of this report to the protocol.\nPatients\nPatients 16 years of age or older with a temperature of 38°C or higher within 12 hours before enrollment and who were receiving antimicrobial therapy for a known or suspected infection were eligible for inclusion. Among the exclusion criteria were acute brain disorders and liver dysfunction that contraindicated the use of acetaminophen. A full list of exclusion criteria is provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.\nRandomization and Study Drugs\nEligible patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either an infusion containing 1 g of intravenous acetaminophen (Perfalgan, Bristol-Myers Squibb) or an infusion of 5% dextrose in water, every 6 hours. The study medications were packaged in indistinguishable 100-ml glass bottles. Randomization was performed with the use of an encrypted Web-based system involving block randomization with a block size of six and was stratified according to participating center. Investigators were unaware of the randomization block size.\nPatients continued to receive the study drug until 28 days after enrollment or until the occurrence of one of the prespecified cessation criteria: discharge from the ICU, resolution of fever as defined by a prespecified algorithm (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix), cessation of antimicrobial therapy, death, or the development of a contraindication to the study drug.\nRescue physical cooling was permitted if the body temperature rose to 39.5°C or higher.

The use of open-label acetaminophen was permitted after the course of study medication was completed. The use of other treatments to reduce body temperature was restricted by the protocol (see the Supplementary Appendix).\nOutcome Measures\nThe primary outcome measure was ICU-free days to day 28.14 ICU-free days is a composite outcome combining mortality and ICU length of stay. The number of ICU-free days was calculated as 28 minus the number of days or part-days spent in the ICU during the first 28 days after randomization (excluding any days of ICU readmission); patients who died were assigned the worst possible outcome of zero ICU-free days.14\nSecondary outcomes, within a 90-day follow-up period, were all-cause mortality at day 28 and day 90; survival time (number of days alive) from randomization until day 90; ICU and hospital length of stay; and hospital-free days, days free from mechanical ventilation, days free from inotropes or vasopressors, days free from renal-replacement therapy, and days in the ICU that were free from support. To be deemed free from support in the ICU, a patient was required to be free from mechanical ventilation, inotropes or vasopressors, and renal-replacement therapy for an entire calendar day and had to remain free from such supports until discharge from the ICU. Patients who died were assigned zero days for all outcome measures involving freedom from support or hospital-free days.\nPhysiological- and laboratory-related outcome variables were mean and maximum axillary temperature; the proportion of patients who stopped the study drug owing to the development of liver dysfunction; mean serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels measured in the ICU on days 1, 3, 5, and 7; the proportion of patients in the ICU with a serum creatine kinase level of more than 5000 units on days 1, 3, 5, or 7; and highest serum creatinine level in the ICU during the first 7 days after randomization.\nThe primary outcome was examined in four prespecified subgroups defined according to the following prerandomization criteria: the presence or absence of septic shock (defined as sepsis-induced hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation), the use or nonuse of aspirin, the presence or absence of high fever (defined as a temperature of ≥39°C in the 12 hours before enrollment), and the location of infection acquisition (community, hospital, or ICU). Full details of the study design can be found in the protocol.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe statistical analysis plan was reported before the interim analysis was conducted.15 On the basis of an inception cohort study16, we assumed a mean control value of 16.0±9.2 ICU-free days. With this assumption and allowing for a 15% inflation in sample size to account for the use of a rank-based test15 and an additional 5% inflation to account for loss to follow-up, we calculated that a sample size of 700 patients would provide 80% power to detect an absolute difference of 2.2 ICU-free days at 28 days after randomization, at an alpha level of 0.05.\nAll analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis with masking to study-group assignments. We defined the intention-to-treat population as all enrolled patients except those who withdrew consent for use of data. We made no imputation for missing values. For the primary analysis comparing ICU-free days between study groups, we used a Wilcoxon rank-sum test and present results as point estimates of absolute difference, using 96.2% confidence intervals to account for the interim efficacy analysis conducted after enrollment of 233 patients. Point estimates of absolute difference that are provided are the median of all paired differences between observations in the two groups, calculated with the use of the Hodges–Lehmann method.17\nThe risk of death at day 28 and day 90 was estimated by means of Poisson regression and is presented as a relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. For mortality at day 28 and day 90, adjusted analyses were performed with the use of multivariate Poisson regression. Prespecified covariates were age, ICU admission source, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score.18 We compared survival times to day 90 using log-rank tests and present these as Kaplan–Meier curves and used a Cox proportional-hazards model to calculate hazard ratios for death. ICU and hospital length of stay were compared in the overall study groups and, as prespecified, among survivors and nonsurvivors separately.\nFor the prespecified subgroups, we performed a proportional-odds analysis with the number of ICU-free days categorized as 0 to 7 days, 8 to 14 days, 15 to 21 days, or 22 to 27 days. This facilitated a formal test for subgroup heterogeneity with an interaction term. All analyses were conducted with the use of SAS statistical software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute). Two-sided P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance, except in the case of the primary outcome, for which a P value of 0.0379 or less was used.19\nStudy results were initially reviewed by the management committee, whose members were unaware of the study-group assignments.

All analyses were conducted with the use of SAS statistical software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute). Two-sided P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance, except in the case of the primary outcome, for which a P value of 0.0379 or less was used.19\nStudy results were initially reviewed by the management committee, whose members were unaware of the study-group assignments. Post hoc analyses were performed to further evaluate the effects of the study drugs on temperature and the use of cointerventions that might have affected body temperature before the study-group assignments were unmasked. Additional details of statistical analyses and post hoc analyses are available in the Supplementary Appendix.\nResults\nPatient Characteristics\nFrom February 2013 through July 2014, we enrolled 700 patients in 23 adult medical–surgical ICUs in Australia and New Zealand, with 352 patients assigned to receive acetaminophen and 348 to receive placebo (Figure 1). Ten participants withdrew consent, resulting in an intention-to-treat population of 690, of whom 346 were assigned to receive acetaminophen and 344 were assigned to receive placebo. Data on the primary outcome were available for the entire intention-to-treat population.\nFigure 1\n\nScreening, Randomization, and Follow-up.\nThe study groups had similar characteristics at baseline (Table 1, and Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The most common sites of infection were the lungs and the abdomen. A causative organism was identified in 217 of 347 patients (62.5%) assigned to acetaminophen and in 214 of 344 patients (62.2%) assigned to placebo (Tables S4 and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\nThe median number of doses of study drug was 8 (interquartile range, 5 to 14) in the acetaminophen group and 9 (interquartile range, 6 to 15) in the placebo group (absolute difference, −1 dose; 95% confidence interval [CI], −2 to 0; P=0.15) (Fig. S2A in the Supplementary Appendix). The study drug was administered in accordance with the protocol in 281 of 347 patients (81.0%) assigned to acetaminophen and in 289 of 344 patients (84.0%) assigned to placebo. All protocol deviations are listed in Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix. The most common reasons for discontinuation of the study drug were discharge from the ICU and resolution of fever (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nOpen-label acetaminophen was administered in the ICU in 104 of 347 patients (30.0%) assigned to acetaminophen and in 101 of 344 patients (29.4%) assigned to placebo (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.19; P=0.86) and was used predominantly in the latter phases of ICU treatment (Fig. S2B and S2C in the Supplementary Appendix). There were no significant differences between study groups in the use of physical cooling or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (Fig. S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nPhysiological Effects\nPatients assigned to receive acetaminophen had a lower mean daily peak body temperature than those assigned to placebo (38.4±1.0°C vs. 38.6±0.8°C; absolute difference, −0.25°C; 95% CI, −0.38 to −0.11; P<0.001) and a lower mean daily average body temperature (37.0±0.6°C vs. 37.3±0.6°C; absolute difference, −0.28°C; 95% CI, −0.37 to −0.19; P<0.001) (Fig. S5 and S6 and Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The study drug was discontinued because of sustained resolution of fever in 79 of 347 patients (22.8%) assigned to acetaminophen and in 58 of 344 patients (16.9%) assigned to placebo (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.99 to 2.12; P=0.05). Among patients in whom the study drug was discontinued owing to discharge from the ICU, 19 of 154 patients (12.3%) assigned to acetaminophen and 37 of 161 patients (23.0%) assigned to placebo had a temperature of 38°C or higher on their last day in the ICU (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.86; P=0.01). CRP, creatinine, and creatine kinase values were similar in the two groups (Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nPrimary Outcome\nThe number of ICU-free days to day 28 did not differ significantly between the acetaminophen group and the placebo group: 23 days (interquartile range, 13 to 25) among patients assigned to acetaminophen and 22 days (interquartile range, 12 to 25) among patients assigned to placebo (absolute difference, 0 days; 96.2% CI, 0 to 1; P=0.07) (Table 2). The distribution of ICU-free days according to study group is shown in Figure S7 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nTable 2\n\nStudy Outcomes.\nSecondary Outcomes\nThere were no significant differences between the acetaminophen group and the\n######################\nOutput:"

The results were consistent in a multivariable analysis (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix), in an analysis of mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU), and in an analysis of 28-day mortality. Subgroup analyses showed no interaction of mortality with baseline severity of hypoxemia, respiratory compliance, body-mass index, or use or nonuse of vasopressors or with center experience in the trial (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nProbability of Survival from the Day of Randomization to Day 60 in the HFOV and Control Groups.\nTable 4\n\nOutcomes.\nEarly Physiological Responses to Ventilation\nTable S3 in the Supplementary Appendix shows early physiological responses to HFOV and to control ventilation. The use of vasopressors was similar in the HFOV and control groups before the initiation of ventilation (66% and 61%, respectively; P=0.24) but increased in the HFOV group as compared with the control group within 4 hours after initiation (73% vs. 62%, P=0.01) and increased even more in the HFOV group by the following day (78% vs. 58%, P<0.001). The use of neuromuscular blockers followed a similar pattern: 27% of patients in the HFOV group and 29% of those in the control group received neuromuscular blockers before the initiation of ventilation (P=0.66), 46% as compared with 31% received them within 4 hours after initiation (P<0.001), and 46% as compared with 26% received them the next day (P<0.001). The mean FiO2 at these time points decreased to a similar extent in both groups: the FiO2 was 0.75 in the HFOV group and 0.73 in the control group before initiation (P=0.93); 0.62 and 0.64 in the two groups, respectively, 4 hours after initiation (P=0.94); and 0.51 and 0.50, respectively, the next day (P=0.97).\nCardiorespiratory Results\nTable S4 in the Supplementary Appendix shows cardiorespiratory data from the first week of the study. On day 1, the mean (±SD) of the mean airway pressure in the HFOV group was 31±2.6 cm of water, with a frequency of 5.5±1.0 Hz; patients in the control group underwent ventilation with a tidal volume of 6.1±1.3 ml per kilogram, PEEP of 18±3.2, and plateau pressure of 32±5.7 cm of water. The mean FiO2 in the control group was similar to or lower than that in the HFOV group, despite lower mean airway pressures. The net fluid balance was higher in the HFOV group than in the control group, but the difference was not significant. In the HFOV group, 270 of the 275 patients (98%) underwent HFOV for a median of 3 days (interquartile range, 2 to 8); a total of 222 patients (81%) survived and were transitioned to conventional ventilation for a further 5 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). In the control group, 34 patients (12%) crossed over to HFOV (31 according to protocol and 3 in violation of protocol) for 7 days (interquartile range, 5 to 15), beginning 2 days (interquartile range, 1 to 4) after randomization; 24 of those 34 patients (71%) died in the hospital.\nCointerventions\nDuring the course of the study, larger proportions of patients in the HFOV group than in the control group received vasoactive drugs (91% vs. 84%, P=0.01) and neuromuscular blockers (83% vs. 68%, P<0.001); vasoactive drugs were administered for an average of 2 days longer in the HFOV group than in the control group, and neuromuscular blockers were administered for an average of 1 day longer in the HFOV group (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Sedatives and opioids (most commonly midazolam and fentanyl) were administered for the same duration in the two groups (median, 10 days [interquartile range, 6 to 18] and 10 days [interquartile range, 6 to 17], respectively; P=0.99), but during the first week the median doses of midazolam were significantly higher in the HFOV group than in the control group (199 mg per day [interquartile range, 100 to 382] vs. 141 mg per day [interquartile range, 68 to 240], P<0.001), and there was a trend toward higher doses of fentanyl equivalents in the HFOV group (2980 μg per day [interquartile range, 1258 to 4800] vs. 2400 μg per day [interquartile range, 1140 to 4430], P=0.06) (for daily doses of selected sedative and analgesic drugs, see Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).The rates of use of other cointerventions, including glucocorticoids, renal-replacement therapy, and prone positioning\n######################\nOutput:"

The same mechanical-ventilation strategies were used in both groups, including a strategy involving a high PEEP. The primary end point was in-hospital death from any cause at 90 days.\nResults\nThe trial was stopped at the second interim analysis for futility. We enrolled 1006 patients early after the onset of moderate-to-severe ARDS (median, 7.6 hours after onset). During the first 48 hours after randomization, 488 of the 501 patients (97.4%) in the intervention group started a continuous infusion of cisatracurium (median duration of infusion, 47.8 hours; median dose, 1807 mg), and 86 of the 505 patients (17.0%) in the control group received a neuromuscular blocking agent (median dose, 38 mg). At 90 days, 213 patients (42.5%) in the intervention group and 216 (42.8%) in the control group had died before hospital discharge (between-group difference, −0.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, −6.4 to 5.9; P=0.93). While in the hospital, patients in the intervention group were less physically active and had more adverse cardiovascular events than patients in the control group. There were no consistent between-group differences in end points assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months.\nConclusions\nAmong patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS who were treated with a strategy involving a high PEEP, there was no significant difference in mortality at 90 days between patients who received an early and continuous cisatracurium infusion and those who were treated with a usual-care approach with lighter sedation targets. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; ROSE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02509078.)\n\nQuick Take\nInvestigating Neuromuscular Blockade for ARDS\n1m 56s\nThe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory form of lung injury that results in respiratory failure with hypoxemia, decreased lung compliance, and bilateral alveolar opacities on chest imaging.1 It is well established that the approaches used for the application of mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS can affect survival and outcomes after discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). For example, neuromuscular blockade reduces patient–ventilator dyssynchrony, the work of breathing, and the accumulation of alveolar fluid; patients with ARDS could benefit from these outcomes.2 However, prolonged administration of neuromuscular blocking agents is associated with subsequent neuromuscular weakness.3,4 The largest multicenter trial to date (the ARDS et Curarisation Systematique [ACURASYS] trial)5 was conducted a decade ago, and ICU practices have changed since then. The investigators of that trial reported that the early administration of a 48-hour infusion of neuromuscular blockade in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen [Pao2] to the fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio2] of <150 mm Hg with a positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] of ≥5 cm of water) resulted in lower mortality than a strategy of deep sedation without routine neuromuscular blockade.5 Despite these encouraging results, early neuromuscular blockade is not widely adopted and is only weakly recommended in current guidelines.6-9 Potential concerns include the lack of research comparing neuromuscular blockade and deep sedation with current practice (which promotes lighter sedation targets8,10–12) as well as limited data on the effect of neuromuscular blockade on neuromuscular function and other long-term outcomes.2,13 In addition, neuromuscular blockade requires deep sedation, which itself can result in negative outcomes.6,12,14\nThe Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL) Clinical Trials Network of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) conducted the Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial — a multicenter, unblinded, randomized trial of patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS — to determine the efficacy and safety of early neuromuscular blockade with concomitant heavy sedation as compared with a strategy of usual care with lighter sedation targets. We hypothesized that the use of early neuromuscular blockade would result in lower all-cause in-hospital mortality at 90 days than usual care.\nMethods\nTrial Design and Oversight\nWe designed the ROSE trial to be consistent with certain elements of the ACURASYS trial.5,15 Similarities included the use of the same neuromuscular blocking agent (cisatracurium) with the same dosing regimen and duration of treatment. A key difference was our use of lighter sedation targets in the control group to be consistent with current practice recommendations.6,8,9 To minimize potentially confounding differences in the use of cointerventions, we specified the approach to mechanical ventilation in the protocol\n######################\nOutput:"

We conducted a trial to determine whether these findings were generalizable and whether all aspects of the protocol were necessary.\nMethods\nIn 31 emergency departments in the United States, we randomly assigned patients with septic shock to one of three groups for 6 hours of resuscitation: protocol-based EGDT; protocol-based standard therapy that did not require the placement of a central venous catheter, administration of inotropes, or blood transfusions; or usual care. The primary end point was 60-day in-hospital mortality. We tested sequentially whether protocol-based care (EGDT and standard-therapy groups combined) was superior to usual care and whether protocol-based EGDT was superior to protocol-based standard therapy. Secondary outcomes included longer-term mortality and the need for organ support.\nResults\nWe enrolled 1341 patients, of whom 439 were randomly assigned to protocol-based EGDT, 446 to protocol-based standard therapy, and 456 to usual care. Resuscitation strategies differed significantly with respect to the monitoring of central venous pressure and oxygen and the use of intravenous fluids, vasopressors, inotropes, and blood transfusions. By 60 days, there were 92 deaths in the protocol-based EGDT group (21.0%), 81 in the protocol-based standard-therapy group (18.2%), and 86 in the usual-care group (18.9%) (relative risk with protocol-based therapy vs. usual care, 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.31; P=0.83; relative risk with protocol-based EGDT vs. protocol-based standard therapy, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.51; P=0.31). There were no significant differences in 90-day mortality, 1-year mortality, or the need for organ support.\nConclusions\nIn a multicenter trial conducted in the tertiary care setting, protocol-based resuscitation of patients in whom septic shock was diagnosed in the emergency department did not improve outcomes. (Funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences; ProCESS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00510835.)\nThere are more than 750,000 cases of severe sepsis and septic shock in the United States each year.1 Most patients who present with sepsis receive initial care in the emergency department, and the short-term mortality is 20% or more.2,3 In 2001, Rivers et al. reported that among patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in a single urban emergency department, mortality was significantly lower among those who were treated according to a 6-hour protocol of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) than among those who were given standard therapy (30.5% vs. 46.5%).4 On the basis of the premise that usual care lacked aggressive, timely assessment and treatment, the protocol for EGDT called for central venous catheterization to monitor central venous pressure and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), which were used to guide the use of intravenous fluids, vasopressors, packed red-cell transfusions, and dobutamine in order to achieve prespecified physiological targets. In the decade since the publication of that article, there have been many changes in the management of sepsis, raising the question of whether all elements of the protocol are still necessary.5–7\nTo address this question, we designed a multicenter trial comparing alternative resuscitation strategies in a broad cohort of patients with septic shock. Specifically, we tested whether protocol-based resuscitation was superior to usual care and whether a protocol with central hemodynamic monitoring to guide the use of fluids, vasopressors, blood transfusions, and dobutamine was superior to a simpler protocol that did not include these elements.\nMethods\nStudy Oversight\nWe conducted the multicenter, randomized Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock (ProCESS) trial at 31 hospitals in the United States. The institutional review board at the University of Pittsburgh and at each other participating site approved the registered study protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The National Institute of General Medical Sciences funded the study and convened an independent data and safety monitoring board (see the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). The ScvO2 monitoring equipment for the study was loaned to the sites by Edwards Lifesciences, but the company had no other role in the study. Study coordinators at each site entered data into a secure Web-based data-collection instrument. The University of Pittsburgh Clinical Research, Investigation, and Systems Modeling of Acute Illness (CRISMA) Center managed all the data and generated blinded and unblinded reports for the data and safety monitoring board. We reported the statistical analysis plan before the data were unblinded.8 The clinical coordinating team and investigators at the participating sites remained unaware of the study-group outcomes until the data were locked in December 2013. The writing committee vouches for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol.\nSites and Patients\nAll the participating sites were academic hospitals with more than 40,000 emergency department visits yearly.

The antiinflammatory activity of drotrecogin alfa activated may be mediated indirectly through the inhibition of the generation of thrombin, which leads to decreased activation of platelets, recruitment of neutrophils, and degranulation of mast cells.8 Furthermore, preclinical studies demonstrated that activated protein C has direct antiinflammatory properties, including the inhibition of neutrophil activation, the production of cytokines by lipopolysaccharide-challenged monocytes, and E-selectin–mediated adhesion of cells to vascular endothelium.32–34\nA consistent effect of treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated was seen among the subgroups examined, including those stratified according to age, APACHE II score, sex, number of dysfunctional organs or systems, type of infection (gram-positive, gram-negative, or mixed), site of infection, and presence or absence of protein C deficiency at study entry. Reductions in the relative risk of death were observed regardless of whether the patients had a deficiency of protein C at base line, suggesting that drotrecogin alfa activated has pharmacologic effects that go beyond simple physiologic replacement of activated protein C. This observation further suggests that measurements of protein C are not necessary to identify which patients would benefit from treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated. A consistent treatment effect was also observed regardless of the site of infection or the type of infection.\nIt was consistent with the antithrombotic activity of drotrecogin alfa activated that bleeding was the most common adverse event associated with the administration of the drug. The incidence of serious bleeding suggests that 1 additional serious bleeding event would occur for every 66 patients treated with drotrecogin alfa activated. Serious bleeding tended to occur in patients with predisposing conditions, such as gastrointestinal ulceration, traumatic injury of a blood vessel or highly vascular organ injury, or markedly abnormal values for indicators of coagulation (e.g., the platelet count, the activated partial-thromboplastin time, and the prothrombin time). The incidence of thrombotic events was not increased by treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated, and the antiinflammatory effect was not associated with an increased incidence of new infections. Treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated was not associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies against activated protein C.\nIn summary, the biologic activity of drotrecogin alfa activated was demonstrated by the finding of greater decreases in D-dimer and interleukin-6 levels in patients who received drotrecogin alfa activated than in those who received placebo. The higher incidence of serious bleeding during infusion in the drotrecogin alfa activated group is consistent with the antithrombotic activity of the drug and occurs predominantly in patients with a predisposition to bleeding. In patients with severe sepsis, an intravenous infusion of drotrecogin alfa activated at a dose of 24 μg per kilogram per hour for 96 hours was associated with a significant reduction in mortality and a safety profile that was acceptable within the context of this clinical trial.\n######################\nOutput:"

The antiinflammatory activity of drotrecogin alfa activated may be mediated indirectly through the inhibition of the generation of thrombin, which leads to decreased activation of platelets, recruitment of neutrophils, and degranulation of mast cells.8 Furthermore, preclinical studies demonstrated that activated protein C has direct antiinflammatory properties, including the inhibition of neutrophil activation, the production of cytokines by lipopolysaccharide-challenged monocytes, and E-selectin–mediated adhesion of cells to vascular endothelium.32–34\nA consistent effect of treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated was seen among the subgroups examined, including those stratified according to age, APACHE II score, sex, number of dysfunctional organs or systems, type of infection (gram-positive, gram-negative, or mixed), site of infection, and presence or absence of protein C deficiency at study entry. Reductions in the relative risk of death were observed regardless of whether the patients had a deficiency of protein C at base line, suggesting that drotrecogin alfa activated has pharmacologic effects that go beyond simple physiologic replacement of activated protein C. This observation further suggests that measurements of protein C are not necessary to identify which patients would benefit from treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated. A consistent treatment effect was also observed regardless of the site of infection or the type of infection.\nIt was consistent with the antithrombotic activity of drotrecogin alfa activated that bleeding was the most common adverse event associated with the administration of the drug. The incidence of serious bleeding suggests that 1 additional serious bleeding event would occur for every 66 patients treated with drotrecogin alfa activated. Serious bleeding tended to occur in patients with predisposing conditions, such as gastrointestinal ulceration, traumatic injury of a blood vessel or highly vascular organ injury, or markedly abnormal values for indicators of coagulation (e.g., the platelet count, the activated partial-thromboplastin time, and the prothrombin time). The incidence of thrombotic events was not increased by treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated, and the antiinflammatory effect was not associated with an increased incidence of new infections. Treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated was not associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies against activated protein C.\nIn summary, the biologic activity of drotrecogin alfa activated was demonstrated by the finding of greater decreases in D-dimer and interleukin-6 levels in patients who received drotrecogin alfa activated than in those who received placebo. The higher incidence of serious bleeding during infusion in the drotrecogin alfa activated group is consistent with the antithrombotic activity of the drug and occurs predominantly in patients with a predisposition to bleeding. In patients with severe sepsis, an intravenous infusion of drotrecogin alfa activated at a dose of 24 μg per kilogram per hour for 96 hours was associated with a significant reduction in mortality and a safety profile that was acceptable within the context of this clinical trial."

Rivers et al. reported nearly perfect adherence but did not provide details regarding the assessment method. Although adherence to the protocol was high in our study, we cannot exclude the possibility that the outcome would have been better if adherence had been perfect. We believe that the rate of adherence in our study parallels the likely performance in any widespread effort targeting the care of patients with septic shock. Furthermore, changes during the past decade in the care of critically ill patients, including the use of lower hemoglobin levels as a threshold for transfusion, the implementation of lung-protection strategies, and the use of tighter control of blood sugar, may have helped lower the overall mortality and may have reduced the marginal benefit of alternative resuscitation strategies.9,10,16,17\nIn 2010, Jones et al. reported the results of a randomized trial involving a patient population similar to ours (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). That trial showed that an EGDT protocol that was based on serial measurement of serum lactate levels was not inferior to an EGDT protocol that used ScvO2 monitoring.14 In-hospital mortality and the use of intravenous fluids, blood transfusions, and dobutamine were similar to those seen in the ProCESS trial. Other studies showing the benefit of EGDT in adults presenting to the emergency department with septic shock have been observational and open to potential confounding.18\nThere are important limitations to our study. First, although we took many steps to ensure close adherence to the resuscitation protocols, we cannot be sure that elements critical to the success of the protocol in the study by Rivers et al. were not lost during dissemination. Second, we enrolled patients who were recognized to be in septic shock. Our study does not address the extent to which any of these strategies offer advantages in settings where septic shock is not recognized promptly. Third, septic shock occurs in a heterogeneous population, and care before randomization can be variable. Fourth, we had limited power to address whether particular strategies were more effective in specific subgroups. Two ongoing multicenter trials of EGDT, the Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE) trial in Australia (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975793) and the Protocolised Management in Sepsis (ProMISe) trial in the United Kingdom (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN36307479) may offer additional insight.19,20 Finally, in-hospital mortality among patients requiring life support is strongly influenced by varying practices regarding the withdrawal of care, which could have influenced our findings.\nIn summary, in our multicenter, randomized trial, in which patients were identified early in the emergency department as having septic shock and received antibiotics and other nonresuscitation aspects of care promptly, we found no significant advantage, with respect to mortality or morbidity, of protocol-based resuscitation over bedside care that was provided according to the treating physician's judgment. We also found no significant benefit of the mandated use of central venous catheterization and central hemodynamic monitoring in all patients.\n######################\nOutput:"

That trial showed that an EGDT protocol that was based on serial measurement of serum lactate levels was not inferior to an EGDT protocol that used ScvO2 monitoring.14 In-hospital mortality and the use of intravenous fluids, blood transfusions, and dobutamine were similar to those seen in the ProCESS trial. Other studies showing the benefit of EGDT in adults presenting to the emergency department with septic shock have been observational and open to potential confounding.18\nThere are important limitations to our study. First, although we took many steps to ensure close adherence to the resuscitation protocols, we cannot be sure that elements critical to the success of the protocol in the study by Rivers et al. were not lost during dissemination. Second, we enrolled patients who were recognized to be in septic shock. Our study does not address the extent to which any of these strategies offer advantages in settings where septic shock is not recognized promptly. Third, septic shock occurs in a heterogeneous population, and care before randomization can be variable. Fourth, we had limited power to address whether particular strategies were more effective in specific subgroups. Two ongoing multicenter trials of EGDT, the Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE) trial in Australia (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975793) and the Protocolised Management in Sepsis (ProMISe) trial in the United Kingdom (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN36307479) may offer additional insight.19,20 Finally, in-hospital mortality among patients requiring life support is strongly influenced by varying practices regarding the withdrawal of care, which could have influenced our findings.\nIn summary, in our multicenter, randomized trial, in which patients were identified early in the emergency department as having septic shock and received antibiotics and other nonresuscitation aspects of care promptly, we found no significant advantage, with respect to mortality or morbidity, of protocol-based resuscitation over bedside care that was provided according to the treating physician's judgment. We also found no significant benefit of the mandated use of central venous catheterization and central hemodynamic monitoring in all patients."

For patients with missing data, we used the last-observation-carried-forward method of imputation. The proportion of patients who had serious adverse events and new infections was compared in the two groups with the use of Pearson's chi-square tests. All reported P values are two-sided.\nResults\nAt the time of the second interim analysis of data from 1520 patients, enrollment was suspended because the differences in the mortality rate between the two groups exceeded the a priori guideline for stopping the trial. Results presented here include data from additional patients who were enrolled before the completion of the second interim analysis.\nBase-Line Characteristics of the Patients\nOf 1728 patients who underwent randomization, 1690 received the study drug or placebo. Thirty-eight patients (17 in the placebo group and 21 in the drotrecogin alfa activated group) never received any study drug. In the drotrecogin alfa activated group, 14 patients met at least one exclusion criterion, 4 patients became moribund before the infusion could be started, and consent was withdrawn before the infusion in the case of 3 patients. In the placebo group, 15 patients did not meet the entry criteria for the study, and 2 patients became moribund before the infusion was begun.\nAll randomized patients were followed for the entire 28-day study period except for one patient in the drotrecogin alfa activated group who did not receive the study drug. This patient was classified as having died on day 28 in the mortality analysis of all randomized patients.\nAt base line, the demographic characteristics and severity of disease were similar in the placebo group and the drotrecogin alfa activated group (Table 1). Approximately 75 percent of the patients had at least two dysfunctional organs or systems at the time of enrollment. The lungs and the abdomen were the most common sites of infection, occurring in 53.6 percent and 19.9 percent of the patients, respectively, in the two groups combined (Table 2). The incidence of gram-positive and gram-negative infections was similar within each group and between the two groups. A blinded clinical evaluation committee determined that clinically appropriate antibiotic therapy that was based on the site of infection and available culture and susceptiblitily data was started within 48 hours of the diagnosis of severe sepsis and continued for at least five days or until death in 776 patients in the drotrecogin alfa activated group (91.3 percent) and in 766 patients in the placebo group (91.2 percent). Base-line levels of indicators of coagulopathy and inflammation were also similar in the two groups (Table 3). Protein C deficiency was present in 87.6 percent of the patients (1379 of 1574) for whom levels were obtained. In addition, plasma D-dimer and serum interleukin-6 levels were elevated in 99.7 and 98.5 percent of the patients, respectively. Among treated patients, 82.4 percent of those in the placebo group and 81.8 percent of those in the drotrecogin alfa activated group received at least 90 percent of the intended infusion and 8.2 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively, died during the 96-hour period of infusion.\nTable 1\n\nBase-Line Characteristics of the Patients.\nTable 2\n\nSites and Causes of Infection in Patients with Severe Sepsis.\nTable 3\n\nBase-Line Levels of Indicators of Coagulation and Inflammation.\nEfficacy\nTwenty-eight days after the start of the infusion, 259 of 840 patients in the placebo group (30.8 percent) and 210 of 850 (24.7 percent) of the patients in the drotrecogin alfa activated group had died. This difference in the rate of death from any cause was significant (P=0.005 in the nonstratified analysis) (Table 4) and was associated with an absolute reduction in the risk of death of 6.1 percent. The prospectively defined primary analysis in which the groups were stratified according to the base-line APACHE II score, age, and protein C activity produced similar results (P=0.005), as did the analysis that included the 38 patients who underwent randomization but who never received the infusion (P=0.003). The results of the prospectively defined primary analysis represent a reduction in the relative risk of death of 19.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6.6 to 30.5) in association with treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated, as compared with placebo. A Kaplan–Meier analysis of survival yielded similar results (P=0.006) (Figure 2). The absolute difference in survival between the two groups was evident within days after the initiation of the infusion and continued to increase throughout the remainder of the study period.\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan–Meier Estimates of Survival among 850 Patients with Severe Sepsis in the Drotrecogin Alfa Activated Group and 840 Patients with Severe Sepsis in the Placebo Group.\nTable 4\n\nAnalysis of the Rates and Risks of Death from Any Cause at 28 Days.\nProspectively defined subgroup analyses were performed for a number of base-line characteristics, including the APACHE II score, the number of dysfunctional organs or systems, other indicators of the severity of disease, sex, age, the site of infection, the type of infection (gram-positive, gram-negative, or mixed), and presence or absence of protein C deficiency.

We used a primary outcome that is not subject to observer bias. To further minimize bias, we published the statistical analysis plan15 and conducted all analyses, including post hoc analyses, before unmasking the study-group assignments. Although our predominantly nonsurgical patient population had low mortality, illness-severity scores were higher than those observed in a recent trial involving patients with septic shock.24 Moreover, our results are generalizable because we studied the broad population of ICU patients with infections who receive acetaminophen to treat fever in routine practice. We used the intravenous formulation of acetaminophen to eliminate any confounding that might be attributable to impaired and unpredictable enteral absorption.\nOur study has certain limitations. The median duration of study-drug administration was short, and approximately one third of the patients in each study group were exposed to acetaminophen in the ICU after the course of study-drug administration had been completed. Consequently, our study findings are relevant primarily to the early use of acetaminophen to treat fever in the ICU. We did not collect information about the use of acetaminophen before randomization or after ICU discharge. Protocol deviations were minor and were unlikely to have materially affected our findings.\nOur findings suggest that acetaminophen has a modest clinical effect as an antipyretic in ICU patients with fever and probable infection but does not reduce ICU-free days in these patients. Our observation that early administration of acetaminophen to treat fever is associated with a longer ICU stay than placebo among nonsurvivors and a shorter stay among survivors must be regarded as hypothesis-generating, thereby requiring caution in interpretation. Such findings may relate to the physiological effects of reducing fever3 and the way that these effects may influence clinicians’ perception of the patient’s illness severity, prognosis, or both. This perception may induce clinicians to discharge improving patients from the ICU faster and to support for a longer period of time patients who will ultimately succumb. An alternative or additional interpretation is that acetaminophen exerts biologically important effects on the natural history of sepsis.\nWe evaluated the administration of acetaminophen to treat fever and administered it for a relatively short period of time. Thus, our results do not preclude the possibility that a more prolonged course of acetaminophen may have a greater influence on patient-centered outcomes. Further studies are required to evaluate this possibility.\nIn conclusion, early administration of acetaminophen to treat fever due to probable infection did not affect the number of ICU-free days. There was no significant between-group difference in 28-day mortality, 90-day mortality, or survival time to day 90.\n######################\nOutput:"

To facilitate comparison, we report all neuromuscular blockade use as the equivalent cisatracurium dose.27\nEnd Points\nThe primary end point was in-hospital death from any cause at 90 days (in-hospital was defined as the time in the trial hospital plus transfer to another hospital, including the time in long-term acute care facilities). Secondary end points were organ dysfunction (as assessed on the basis of the Sequential Organ Failure [SOFA] score28; scores range from 0 to 4 for each of six organ systems, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction), in-hospital death at day 28, days free of organ dysfunction, days not in the ICU, days free of mechanical ventilation, and days not in the hospital at day 28. End points assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months were survival, disability, health-related quality of life, patient-reported health, pain interference, symptoms resembling those of post-traumatic stress, cognitive function, and return to work.29-33 Safety end points included recall of paralysis (assessed with the modified Brice questionnaire), ICU-acquired weakness up to day 28 (assessed with the Medical Research Council scale, which includes scores for muscle strength in 6 muscle groups on each side of the body, for a total of 12 muscle groups; the score for each muscle group can range from 0 [no movement observed] to 5 [the muscle contracts normally against full resistance], with the overall score ranging from 0 to 60), limitations on physical activity (assessed with the ICU Mobility Scale; scores range from 0 [no movement] to 10 [walking without aid]), new-onset atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia, barotrauma, and investigator-reported adverse events.34-38 We could not ensure that the in-hospital assessors of end points were unaware of treatment group, but all postdischarge end points were assessed by trial personnel who were unaware of the group assignment.\nStatistical Analysis\nUnder the assumption that 27% of patients in the intervention group and 35% in the control group would die, we calculated that 1408 patients would need to be enrolled to provide the trial with 90% power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the groups in treatment effect, at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.5,25,39 The trial was designed to be stopped if superiority of either group was established using symmetric group sequential flexible stopping boundaries, with no stopping rule for futility.40 We compared the primary end point between groups with the use of a Wald test for the difference of two proportions. We performed prespecified analyses according to severity of ARDS (Pao2:Fio2 <120 mm Hg or ≥120 mm Hg) and duration of ARDS (a duration less than or greater than the median time from meeting inclusion criteria to randomization) as well as for the potential effect of excluding patients who had previously received neuromuscular blockade (hospitals were divided into terciles on the basis of their exclusion rate of patients who had previously received neuromuscular blockade). We also tested for interactions between treatment group and sex, race, and ethnic group. All treatment-by-subgroup interactions were analyzed on the risk difference scale with the use of a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution function and an identity link function. Secondary end points are reported with observed differences and 95% confidence intervals. Adverse events were compared between groups, with the event the unit of analysis and with the use of weighted Poisson regression; nonserious events were weighted by 1 and serious events were weighted by 2. Mortality at 90 days and at 1 year was compared between the groups with the use of a z-test, which was based on the point estimates and standard errors of the within-group nonparametric interval-censored survival functions. All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Two-sided P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Analyses were performed with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\nResults\nPatients\nFrom January 2016 through April 2018, we screened 4848 patients at 48 hospitals across the United States, and 1006 patients were included in the primary analysis (Figure 1). After the second interim analysis, the decision to stop the trial for futility was made independently by the data and safety monitoring board; the decision was endorsed by the NHLBI and accepted by the PETAL steering committee. The most common reason for exclusion was improvement in the Pao2:Fio2 before enrollment (658 patients). The most common reason for exclusion after screening was the previous receipt of neuromuscular blockade (655 patients). Of the patients who were enrolled, 501 were randomly assigned to the intervention group, and 505 to the control group. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients were enrolled a median of 7.6 hours (interquartile range, 3.7 to 15.6) after diagnosis of moderate-to-severe ARDS; 9.3% of the patients (94 patients) were enrolled with a qualifying Spo2:Fio2 (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 1\n\nPatient Screening, Enrollment, and Follow-up.\nTable 1\n\nBaseline Characteristics of the Patients.\nNeuromuscular Blockade, Sedation, and Other Care Processes\nIn the intervention group, 488 patients (97.4%) received a cisatracurium infusion, beginning a mean (±SD)\n######################\nOutput:"

The writing committee vouches for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol.\nSites and Patients\nAll the participating sites were academic hospitals with more than 40,000 emergency department visits yearly. To be eligible, the study sites had to use the measurement of serum lactate levels as the method for screening for cryptogenic shock and had to adhere to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines9,10 for nonresuscitation aspects of care but could have no routine resuscitation protocols for septic shock and could not routinely use continuous ScvO2 catheters. We recruited patients in the emergency department in whom sepsis was suspected according to the treating physician, who were at least 18 years of age, who met two or more criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome11 (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix), and who had refractory hypotension or a serum lactate level of 4 mmol per liter or higher. We defined refractory hypotension as a systolic blood pressure that either was less than 90 mm Hg or required vasopressor therapy to maintain 90 mm Hg even after an intravenous fluid challenge. We initially required the fluid challenge to be 20 ml or more per kilogram of body weight, administered over the course of 30 minutes, but in April 2010, we simplified the requirement to a challenge of 1000 ml or more administered over the course of 30 minutes. Patients did not have to be in shock on arrival in the emergency department but had to be enrolled in the study in the emergency department within 2 hours after the earliest detection of shock and within 12 hours after arrival. The exclusion criteria are listed in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix. All patients or their legally authorized representatives provided written informed consent. Randomization was performed with the use of a centralized Web-based program in variable block sizes of 3, 6, or 9, with stratification according to site and race.\nStudy Interventions\nWe randomly assigned patients, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to one of three groups: protocol-based EGDT, protocol-based standard therapy, or usual care. The same trained and dedicated physician-led team implemented both the protocol-based EGDT and the protocol-based standard-therapy interventions. The team consisted of at least one available physician who was trained in the protocol-guided resuscitation interventions, a study coordinator who monitored adherence to protocol instructions and provided timed prompts, and a bedside nurse. All study physicians were trained in emergency medicine or critical care medicine and had completed a Web-based certification examination. The protocol-based care began in the emergency department but could be continued elsewhere. Details regarding the training and conduct of the personnel are provided in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix. In cases in which a team physician was the bedside provider before enrollment, care was transferred to a nonstudy physician before enrollment.\nFor patients randomly assigned to protocol-based EGDT, the resuscitation team followed the protocol outlined in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, which mimics that used by Rivers et al.4 The protocol prompted placement of a central venous catheter to monitor pressure and ScvO2 and to administer intravenous fluids, vasopressors, dobutamine, or packed red-cell transfusions, as directed. We did not require placement of an arterial catheter for blood-pressure monitoring. The protocol in our study, like the protocol in the study by Rivers et al., specified the amount and timing, but not the type, of resuscitation fluid. Similarly, the protocol in our study specified thresholds for vasopressor use but not the specific choice of vasopressor. The protocol guided only resuscitation, with all other aspects of care, including the choice of antimicrobial agents, given at the discretion of the treating physician.\nProtocol-based standard therapy also used a team approach with a set of 6-hour resuscitation instructions, but the components were less aggressive than those used for protocol-based EGDT (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). ProCESS investigators designed the protocol-based standard-therapy approach on the basis of a review of the literature, two independent surveys of emergency physician and intensivist practice worldwide,5,12 and consensus feedback from investigators. Protocol-based standard therapy required adequate peripheral venous access (with placement of a central venous catheter only if peripheral access was insufficient) and administration of fluids and vasoactive agents to reach goals for systolic blood pressure and shock index (the ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure) and to address fluid status and hypoperfusion, which were assessed clinically at least once an hour. In contrast to the triggers in the EGDT protocol, protocol-based standard therapy recommended packed red-cell transfusion only if the hemoglobin level was less than 7.5 g per deciliter. The protocol for standard therapy mandated administration of fluids until the team leader decided that the patient's fluids were replete. The standard-therapy protocol, like the EGDT protocol, did not specify the type of fluid or vasopressor and did not specify nonresuscitation aspects of care, which were provided by the treating physician. We assessed adherence to the EGDT and standard-therapy protocols using an algorithm that screened for decision prompts and actions at 2, 4, and 6 hours (Fig. S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFor patients in the usual-care group, the bedside providers directed all care, with the study coordinator collecting data but not prompting any actions. Lead investigators at a site could not serve as the bedside treating physician for patients in the usual-care group.\nOutcome Measures\nThe primary outcome of the study was the rate of in-hospital death from any\n######################\nOutput:"

A consistent effect of treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated was observed among the subgroups (data not shown), including the subgroup with protein C deficiency and the subgroup with normal protein C levels.\nLevels of D-Dimer and Interleukin-6\nPlasma D-dimer levels were significantly lower in patients in the drotrecogin alfa activated group than in patients in the placebo group on days 1 through 7 after the start of the infusion (Figure 3). Decreases in serum interleukin-6 levels were significantly greater in the patients in the drotrecogin alfa activated group than in the patients in the placebo group on day 1 (P=0.009) and on days 4, 5, 6, and 7 (P=0.025, P=0.017, P=0.016, and P=0.022, respectively).\nFigure 3\n\nChanges in Median Plasma D-Dimer Levels in 770 Patients with Severe Sepsis in the Drotrecogin Alfa Activated Group and 729 Patients in the Placebo Group.\nComplications\nThe percentage of patients who had at least one serious adverse event was similar in the two groups (Table 5). The incidence of serious bleeding was higher in the drotrecogin alfa activated group than in the placebo group (3.5 percent vs. 2.0 percent) (P=0.06). This difference in the incidence of serious bleeding was observed only during the infusion period; thereafter, the incidence was similar in the two groups. Among the patients who received drotrecogin alfa activated, the incidence of serious bleeding was similar for those who received drotrecogin alfa activated alone and those who also received heparin (3.7 percent and 3.5 percent). In both the drotrecogin alfa activated group and the placebo group, serious bleeding occurred primarily in patients with an identifiable predisposition to bleeding, such as gastrointestinal ulceration, an activated partial-thromboplastin time of more than 120 seconds, a prolonged prothrombin time (an international normalized ratio of more than 3.0), a platelet count that decreased to less than 30,000 per cubic millimeter and remained at that level despite standard therapy, traumatic injury of a blood vessel, or traumatic injury of a highly vascular organ. There was a fatal intracranial hemorrhage in two patients in the drotrecogin alfa activated group during the infusion (on day 1 and day 4) and in one patient in the placebo group six days after the end of the infusion. After adjustment for the duration of survival, blood-transfusion requirements were similar in the two groups (P=0.90).\nTable 5\n\nIncidence of Serious Adverse Events.\nThere were no other safety concerns associated with treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated on the basis of assessments of organ dysfunction, vital signs, serum chemical data, or hematologic data. The incidence of thrombotic events was similar in the two groups (Table 5). New infections occurred in 25.5 percent of the patients in the drotrecogin alfa activated group and 25.1 percent of the patients in the placebo group (P=0.85). Neutralizing antibodies against activated protein C were not detected in any patient.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, the administration of drotrecogin alfa activated reduced the rate of death from any cause at 28 days in patients with a clinical diagnosis of severe sepsis, resulting in a 19.4 percent reduction in the relative risk of death and an absolute reduction of 6.1 percent. A survival benefit was evident throughout the 28-day study period, whether or not the groups were stratified according to the severity of disease. Our results indicate that in this population, 1 additional life would be saved for every 16 patients treated with drotrecogin alfa activated.\nThough the study population was heterogeneous with respect to clinical features, it was homogeneous with respect to the biochemical evidence of systemic inflammation and coagulopathy. In these patients, the benefit of drotrecogin alfa activated is most likely explained by the drug's biologic activity. Activated protein C inhibits the generation of thrombin by inactivating factor Va and factor VIIIa.30,31 As compared with the patients who received placebo, patients who received drotrecogin alfa activated had greater decreases in plasma D-dimer levels during the first seven days after the infusion was initiated, indicating a reduction in the generation of thrombin. The rise in D-dimer levels after the completion of the 96-hour infusion of drotrecogin alfa activated indicates incomplete resolution of the procoagulant state seen in patients with sepsis. An evaluation of longer periods of infusion of drotrecogin alfa activated may be warranted.\nTreatment with drotrecogin alfa activated decreased inflammation, as indicated by decreases in interleukin-6 levels, a finding consistent with the known antiinflammatory activity of activated protein C. The antiinflammatory activity of drotrecogin alfa activated may be mediated indirectly through the inhibition of the generation of thrombin, which leads to decreased activation of platelets, recruitment of neut\n######################\nOutput:"

The median duration of cisatracurium administration over the 48-hour intervention period was 47.8 hours (interquartile range, 43.8 to 48.0), and the median cumulative dose was 1807 mg (interquartile range, 1706 to 1815). Overall, the cisatracurium infusion was stopped early in 74 patients (14.8%) because of clinical improvement. In the control group, 86 patients (17.0%) received a neuromuscular blocking agent during the first 48 hours at a median cisatracurium (or equivalent) dose of 38 mg (interquartile range, 14 to 200). Additional details on the dosing of neuromuscular blocking agents are provided in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. Patients in the intervention group were under deeper sedation than patients in the control group both during the 48-hour intervention period and on the third trial day (Figure 2). During the first 24 hours, patients in the intervention group had lower PEEP requirements than patients in the control group (between-group difference, −0.9 cm of water; 95% confidence interval [CI], −1.5 to −0.4). During the first and second 24-hour periods, patients in the intervention group also had lower minute ventilation (the between-group difference on day 1 was −0.7 liters per minute [95% CI, −1.1 to −0.2], and on day 2, −0.8 liters per minute [95% CI, −1.2 to −0.4]), lower Fio2 requirements (the between-group difference on both day 1 and day 2 was −0.04 [95% CI, −0.06 to −0.02]), and higher driving pressures (the between-group difference on day 1 was 0.7 cm of water [95% CI, 0.0 to 1.3], and on day 2, 0.8 cm of water [95% CI, 0.1 to −1.5]). However, there were no between-group differences in the Pao2:Fio2 from day 1 through day 7. Improvement in oxygenation was similar among patients who were enrolled early and those who were enrolled late after the onset of ARDS. From day 1 through day 7, there was good adherence to the protocol with respect to PEEP and Fio2 recommendations, and adherence to recommended ventilation guidelines ranged from 80.1 to 87.5% with respect to low tidal volume ventilation (≤6.5 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight) and 85.6 to 90.8% with respect to low plateau pressures (≤30 cm of water). The median daily fluid balance was 327 ml (interquartile range, −951 to 1456) on day 2 and −242 ml (interquartile range, −1432 to 728) on day 3, and there were no differences between trial groups. Additional details are provided in Figure S1 and Tables S4 through S8 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nFigure 2\n\nNeuromuscular Blockade and Sedation.\nPrimary End Point\nAt 90 days, in-hospital death from any cause occurred in 213 patients (42.5%) in the intervention group and in 216 patients (42.8%) in the control group (between-group difference, −0.3 percentage points; 95% CI, −6.4 to 5.9; P=0.93) (Figure 3 and Table 2). Treatment-by-subgroup interactions were not significant with respect to ARDS severity, ARDS duration, or previous neuromuscular blockade use stratified according to hospital tercile. Other than the interaction of treatment assignment with ethnic group (P=0.02 for interaction), no other interactions were significant (Fig. S2 and Tables S9 through S15 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 3\n\nPatients Who Survived to Hospital Discharge and Were Discharged Home during the First 90 Days after Randomization.\nTable 2\n\nEnd Points.\nSecondary End Points\nAt 28 days, there was no between-group difference in hospital mortality, days free of ventilation, days out of the ICU, or days out of the hospital (Table 2). Cardiovascular SOFA scores were higher in the intervention group than in the control group on day 1 (between-group difference, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.4) and day 2 (between-group difference, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.5). However, there were no differences thereafter, nor were there differences in total SOFA scores or other organ-specific SOFA scores. The use of adjunctive therapies appeared to be similar in the two groups during the 48-hour intervention period (between-group difference, 0.7 percentage points; 95% CI, −4.0 to 5.5) and through day 28 (between-group difference, 1.2 percentage points; 95% CI\n######################\nOutput:"

Lead investigators at a site could not serve as the bedside treating physician for patients in the usual-care group.\nOutcome Measures\nThe primary outcome of the study was the rate of in-hospital death from any cause at 60 days. Secondary mortality outcomes included the rate of death from any cause at 90 days and cumulative mortality at 90 days and 1 year. Other outcomes included the duration of acute cardiovascular failure (defined as the duration of the need for vasopressors), acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure (defined as the duration of mechanical ventilation or dialysis during the acute hospitalization, truncated at 60 days, in patients who had not had a long-term need for ventilation or dialysis before enrollment); the duration of the stay in the hospital and intensive care unit; and hospital discharge disposition (i.e., discharge to a long-term or other acute care facility, a nursing home, a private home, or other). We collected information on serious adverse events using standard federal guidelines.13\nStatistical Analysis\nWe analyzed all data according to the intention-to-treat principle. For the primary outcome, our design tested sequentially whether protocol-based resuscitation (EGDT or standard therapy) was superior to usual care and, if it was, whether protocol-based EGDT was superior to protocol-based standard therapy. We initially calculated that with a sample of 1950 patients, the study would have at least 80% power to detect a reduction in mortality of 6 to 7 percentage points, at an alpha level of 0.05 for both hypotheses, assuming mortality of 30 to 46% with usual care; interim analyses were planned after 650 patients and 1300 patients had been enrolled. The trial did not meet the stopping criteria at the first planned interim analysis (after the enrollment of 650 patients). Before the second interim analysis, we observed that the overall mortality was approximately 20%, which was much lower than anticipated but consistent with the results of a recent study involving similar patients.14 After consultation with the data and safety monitoring board and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and with the group assignments still concealed, we calculated that we would need to enroll a total of 1350 patients to preserve the same power for the same absolute risk reduction.\nAfter spending 0.0005 alpha for the first interim analysis, and after recalculation of the sample size (which removed the requirement for a second interim analysis), the alpha level required for the sequential hypotheses was 0.0494, with no adjustment for multiple testing. We tested for between-group differences in the primary outcome using Fisher's exact test. In the event that protocol-based care (EGDT and standard therapy combined) was not superior to usual care, all other analyses were to be specified as secondary. Because of possible site heterogeneity, we also conducted a secondary analysis using a generalized linear mixed model in which we allowed for a random effect of study site, with treatment group as a covariate; assessed significance with the use of type 3 tests; and used compound symmetry for the covariance structure.\nFor other end points, we used Fisher's exact test for categorical outcomes and an analysis of variance for continuous outcomes. For survival analyses, we generated Kaplan–Meier estimates, assessed between-group differences using the log-rank test, and expressed the data as cumulative mortality curves. In prespecified subgroup analyses, we used the Breslow–Day test to assess interactions between treatment assignment and subgroups defined according to age, sex, race, source of infection, and enrollment criterion (refractory hypotension or elevated serum lactate level). We also conducted post hoc subgroup analyses according to thirds of values for the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, for the baseline serum lactate level, and for the time from detection of shock until randomization, using logistic regression to test for an interaction between treatment assignment and subgroups. Unless otherwise specified, analyses are for tests of differences across the three study groups, with P values of less than 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. We used SAS software, version 9.3, for all analyses.\nResults\nPatients\nFrom March 2008 through May 2013, we enrolled 1351 patients (Figure 1, and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Ten patients who provided informed consent later requested complete withdrawal from the study, leaving a final cohort of 1341 patients for the analysis: 439 in the protocol-based EGDT group, 446 in the protocol-based standard-therapy group, and 456 in the usual-care group. The three groups were well matched at baseline with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as the care received before randomization (Table 1, and Tables S1, S2, and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 1\n\nScreening, Randomization, and Follow-up.\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\nAdherence to the Protocol\nAdherence to the protocol was high in both protocol-based groups.

Patients were excluded if they had hypoxemia primarily related to left atrial hypertension, suspected vasculitic pulmonary hemorrhage, neuromuscular disorders that are known to prolong the need for mechanical ventilation, severe chronic respiratory disease, or preexisting conditions with an expected 6-month mortality exceeding 50%; if they were at risk for intracranial hypertension; if there was a lack of commitment to life support; if the expected duration of mechanical ventilation was less than 48 hours; if they were younger than 16 years of age or older than 85 years of age; or if their weight was less than 35 kg or more than 1 kg per centimeter of height. We did not enroll patients who had already met the eligibility criteria for more than 72 hours, those who were already receiving HFOV, or those whose physicians declined to enroll them.\nAfter enrollment, standardized ventilator settings were used for all the patients: pressure-control mode, a tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram, and an FiO2 of 0.60 with a PEEP level of 10 cm of water or higher if needed for oxygenation. After 30 minutes, if the PaO2:FiO2 ratio remained at 200 or lower, patients underwent randomization; otherwise the standardized ventilator settings were maintained, and the patients were reassessed at least once daily for up to 72 hours. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the HFOV group or to the conventional-ventilation group. Randomization was performed in undisclosed block sizes of 2 and 4 with the use of a central Web-based randomization system, stratified according to center. All patients or their legal surrogates provided written informed consent for participation in the study.\nHFOV Protocol\nThe HFOV protocol was designed on the basis of the results of pilot testing and consensus guidelines.24,27 We first conducted a recruitment maneuver, by applying 40 cm of water pressure for 40 seconds to the airway opening in an effort to reopen closed lung units. We then initiated HFOV with a mean airway pressure of 30 cm of water, adjusting the pressure thereafter according to the protocol, targeting a PaO2 of 55 to 80 mm Hg (Table 1 and Table 2). We minimized HFOV tidal volumes by using the highest possible frequency that would maintain arterial blood pH above 7.25.13,28\nTable 1\n\nVentilator Protocols.\nTable 2\n\nUsual Combinations of the Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2) and Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) or Mean Airway Pressure Used to Adjust Ventilators.\nAfter 24 hours of HFOV, conventional ventilation could be resumed if the mean airway pressure was 24 cm of water or less for 12 hours. This transition was mandatory when airway pressures reached 20 cm of water. Thereafter, mechanical ventilation followed the control protocol. Over the next 48 hours, if an FiO2 of more than 0.4 or a PEEP level of more than 14 cm of water was required for more than 1 hour to achieve oxygenation targets, HFOV was resumed.\nControl Ventilation Protocol\nThe control ventilation protocol, which was adapted from an earlier trial,9 called for a target tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram, with plateau airway pressure of 35 cm of water or less and high levels of PEEP. After an initial recruitment maneuver (the same as that used for the HFOV group), clinicians applied ventilation using pressure-control mode with a PEEP level of 20 cm of water and then adjusted the PEEP level and the FiO2 according to the protocol (Table 1 and Table 2). The protocol permitted the use of volume-assist control mode or pressure-support mode with the same limits for tidal volumes and airway pressures. For patients receiving pressure support with PEEP levels of 10 cm of water or less and an FiO2 of 0.4 or less, there were no limits on tidal volume or airway pressures. The weaning protocol, which has been published previously, included daily trials of spontaneous breathing.9,29\nProcedures in Both Groups\nWhen hypoxemia persisted despite increases in PEEP or mean airway pressure, or when, on the basis of radiographic or clinical evidence, physicians judged that the lungs were over-distended, they could reduce PEEP or mean airway pressure to a level below that indicated in the assigned protocol (Table 2).\nFor patients with hypoxemia who required an FiO2 of 0.9 or greater, clinicians could institute therapies for hypoxemia (e.g., prone positioning or inhaled nitric oxide) that did not interfere with the assigned ventilator protocols. Physicians could institute any alternative therapy (including HFOV in the control group) for patients who met any one of the following criteria: refractory hypoxemia (PaO2 <60 mm Hg for 1 hour with an FiO2 of 1.0 and neuromuscular blockade), refractory barotrauma (persistent pneumoth\n######################\nOutput:"

However, its effectiveness is uncertain.\nMethods\nIn this trial conducted at 51 centers (mostly in Australia or New Zealand), we randomly assigned patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock to receive either EGDT or usual care. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 90 days after randomization.\nResults\nOf the 1600 enrolled patients, 796 were assigned to the EGDT group and 804 to the usual-care group. Primary outcome data were available for more than 99% of the patients. Patients in the EGDT group received a larger mean (±SD) volume of intravenous fluids in the first 6 hours after randomization than did those in the usual-care group (1964±1415 ml vs. 1713±1401 ml) and were more likely to receive vasopressor infusions (66.6% vs. 57.8%), red-cell transfusions (13.6% vs. 7.0%), and dobutamine (15.4% vs. 2.6%) (P<0.001 for all comparisons). At 90 days after randomization, 147 deaths had occurred in the EGDT group and 150 had occurred in the usual-care group, for rates of death of 18.6% and 18.8%, respectively (absolute risk difference with EGDT vs. usual care, −0.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, −4.1 to 3.6; P=0.90). There was no significant difference in survival time, in-hospital mortality, duration of organ support, or length of hospital stay.\nConclusions\nIn critically ill patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock, EGDT did not reduce all-cause mortality at 90 days. (Funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and the Alfred Foundation; ARISE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975793.)\nSevere sepsis has a reported annual incidence in adults of up to 300 cases per 100,000 population.1–3 Despite decreasing mortality from sepsis in recent years,4 the risk of death remains high.5,6 The fundamental principles for the management of sepsis include early recognition, control of the source of infection, appropriate and timely administration of antimicrobial drugs, and resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasoactive drugs.\nPatients presenting to the emergency department account for a large proportion of patients with severe sepsis.7 Reported in-hospital mortality ranges in this subgroup from 20 to 50%.3,8–10 In 2001, a proof-of-concept, randomized trial showed that early hemodynamic resuscitation according to a specific protocol termed early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) improved outcomes in patients presenting to the emergency department with severe sepsis, as compared with usual therapy.11\nEGDT was subsequently incorporated into the 6-hour resuscitation bundle of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines,12–14 and a number of nonrandomized studies showed a survival benefit with bundle-based care that included EGDT.15–18 Despite such successes, considerable controversy has surrounded the role of EGDT in the treatment of patients with severe sepsis. Concerns have included the potential risks associated with individual elements of the protocol,19,20 uncertainty about the external validity of the original trial, and the infrastructure and resource requirements for implementing EGDT.21,22\nIn a randomized trial conducted in 31 academic centers in the United States (Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock [ProCESS]),10 protocol-based resuscitation (a combination of EGDT and protocol-based standard therapy) was not associated with a survival benefit, as compared with usual care that was not protocol-based. Whether these results would hold up outside the United States and across a variety of academic and nonacademic health care settings is unknown; more evidence is needed to provide clinical direction.23\nWe designed the multicenter Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE) study to test the hypothesis that EGDT, as compared with usual care, would decrease 90-day all-cause mortality among patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock in diverse health care settings.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Oversight\nFrom October 5, 2008, to April 23, 2014, we conducted this prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial in 51 tertiary care and nontertiary care metropolitan and rural hospitals. Most centers were in Australia or New Zealand, with 6 centers in Finland, Hong Kong, and the Republic of Ireland (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).24 Participating institutions did not have sepsis-resuscitation protocols at the time of site selection, and usual care did not include resuscitation guided by measurement of the central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2).25 The ARISE study was one of three collaborative, harmonized studies, along with the ProCESS trial10 and the Protocolized Management in Sepsis (ProMISe) trial (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN36307479), designed to address the effectiveness of EGDT.24\nThe study protocol was approved by the ethics committee at Monash University, which was the coordinating center, and at each participating institution. The protocol and statistical analysis plan are available at NEJM.org. Prior informed written consent or delayed consent was obtained from all patients or their legal surrogates. The trial was overseen by an independent data and safety monitoring committee. Scv\n######################\nOutput:"

Physicians could institute any alternative therapy (including HFOV in the control group) for patients who met any one of the following criteria: refractory hypoxemia (PaO2 <60 mm Hg for 1 hour with an FiO2 of 1.0 and neuromuscular blockade), refractory barotrauma (persistent pneumothorax or increasing subcutaneous emphysema despite two thoracostomy tubes on the involved side), or refractory acidosis (pH of ≤7.05 despite neuromuscular blockade).\nPhysicians prescribed fluids, sedatives, and neuromuscular blockers at their discretion. We recorded cardiorespiratory variables daily as well as data on cointerventions applied while patients were undergoing mechanical ventilation for up to 60 days. Intensivists reviewed chest radiographs for evidence of new barotrauma. Patients were followed until their discharge from the hospital.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe anticipated that mortality in the control group would be 45%. Assuming a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, we calculated that enrollment of 1200 patients would provide at least 80% power to detect a relative-risk reduction with HFOV of 20%, even if mortality in the control group was as low as 37%.\nInvestigators reviewed feasibility data from the pilot phase, which involved 94 patients, but remained unaware of the clinical outcomes. The independent data monitoring committee reviewed the clinical outcomes from the pilot phase and recommended that the trial continue to the next phase. As originally planned, data from the patients involved in the pilot phase were included in the current analyses. In addition to an interim analysis after 800 patients had undergone randomization, safety analyses of physiological data at the initiation of the study were planned after 300, 500, and 700 patients had undergone randomization. After reviewing these safety data, the data monitoring committee could request analyses of in-hospital mortality, which they did after both the 300-patient and 500-patient safety analyses. With plans to stop the study early only in response to a strong signal of harm in association with the use of HFOV, we used the O'Brien–Fleming method to calculate alpha spending and generated one-sided P values for considering early stopping after random assignment of 300 patients (P≤0.00001), 500 patients (P≤0.0001), and 700 patients (P≤0.0064).\nWe used SAS software, version 9.2, for the statistical analyses. We summarized data using means with standard deviations, medians and interquartile ranges, or proportions. Normally distributed data were compared with the use of Student's t-test, nonnormally distributed data with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and proportions with the use of the Mantel–Haenszel chi-square test, with stratification according to center. We analyzed data from all patients according to their assigned group.\nThe primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, with the outcome compared between the two groups stratified according to center. Other than recording whether death occurred as a result of withdrawal of life support, we did not record specific causes of death. As a sensitivity analysis, we used logistic regression to adjust the treatment effect for prespecified baseline variables: age, the Acute Physiology Score component of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score,30 the presence or absence of sepsis, and the duration of hospitalization before randomization.9 To compare the two groups with respect to the time to death, we used a survival analysis, in which patients who were discharged alive from the hospital were assumed to be alive at day 60.\nWe conducted prespecified subgroup analyses to determine whether there were interactions of the treatment effect with baseline severity of lung injury (in quartiles of the PaO2:FiO2 ratio) or with center experience with HFOV and study protocols (in thirds of number of patients recruited). In addition, we studied interactions of the treatment effect with baseline dynamic compliance measured from tidal breaths during conventional ventilation (in quartiles), baseline body-mass index (in quartiles), and receipt or no receipt of vasopressors at baseline — all post hoc analyses.\nResults\nEarly Termination of the Trial\nAfter the 500-patient analysis, the steering committee terminated the trial, acting on a unanimous recommendation from the data monitoring committee, although the threshold P value for stopping had not been reached. At the time of termination, 571 patients had been enrolled, of whom 548 had undergone randomization: 275 to the HFOV group and 273 to the control-ventilation group (Figure 1). Important prognostic factors were similar in the two groups at baseline (Table 3, and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 1\n\nScreening, Randomization, and Follow-up.\nTable 3\n\nBaseline Characteristics of the Patients.\nMortality\nA total of 129 patients (47%) in the HFOV group, as compared with 96 patients (35%) in the control group, died in the hospital (relative risk of death with HFOV, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.64; P=0.005) (Table 4 and Figure 2). The results were consistent in a multivariable analysis (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix), in an analysis of mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU), and in an analysis of 28-day mortality.

The median time to insertion was 1.1 hours (interquartile range, 0.7 to 1.6), and the mean ScvO2 was 72.7±10.5%. A central venous catheter was inserted during the first 6 hours in 494 patients (61.9%) in the usual-care group. The median time to insertion was 1.2 hours (interquartile range, 0.4 to 2.6). No patients in the usual-care group received continuous ScvO2 monitoring during the first 6 hours.\nThe volume of intravenous fluids administered during the first 6 hours was greater in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group (1964±1415 ml vs. 1713±1401 ml, P<0.001) (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). More patients in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group received a vasopressor infusion (66.6% vs. 57.8%), red-cell transfusion (13.6% vs. 7.0%), or dobutamine (15.4% vs. 2.6%) (P<0.001 for all comparisons) (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Between 6 and 72 hours, the proportion of patients receiving vasopressor infusions was higher in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group (58.8% vs. 51.5%, P=0.004), as was the proportion of patients receiving dobutamine (9.5% vs. 5.0%, P<0.001) (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nEGDT was stopped prematurely in 18 patients (2.3%). The median time to cessation was 3.5 hours (interquartile range, 1.2 to 5.6). The most common reasons were withdrawal of therapy (5 patients), transfer to the operating room (2 patients), and interhospital transfer (3 patients).\nPhysiological and Laboratory Values\nAt the end of the 6-hour intervention period, the mean arterial pressure was higher in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group (76.5±10.8 mm Hg vs. 75.3±11.4 mm Hg, P=0.04). Other physiological and laboratory values were similar in the two groups (Fig. S3 and Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). The proportions of patients in the EGDT group for whom the individual resuscitation goals were achieved at 6 hours or for whom the relevant therapy was delivered when a goal was not achieved were 99.6% for saturation of peripheral oxygen, 88.9% for central venous pressure, 94.1% for mean arterial pressure, and 95.3% for ScvO2 (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). At 72 hours after randomization, physiological and laboratory values were similar in the two groups (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nPrimary Outcome\nBy 90 days after randomization, the primary outcome (death from any cause) had occurred in 147 of 792 patients (18.6%) in the EGDT group and 150 of 796 patients (18.8%) in the usual-care group (P=0.90) (Table 2, and Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). The absolute difference in the risk of death for the EGDT group as compared with the usual care group was −0.3 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], −4.1 to 3.6). The survival time did not differ significantly between the groups (Figure 2A). Between-group mortality was similar in all the predefined subgroups (Figure 2B). There were no significant between-group differences in 90-day mortality with the use of multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazards analysis after adjustment for the prespecified baseline covariates (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nProbability of Survival and Subgroup Analyses of the Risk of Death at 90 Days.\nTable 2\n\nStudy Outcomes.\nSecondary and Tertiary Outcomes\nThe median length of stay in the emergency department after randomization was shorter in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group (1.4 hours [interquartile range, 0.5 to 2.7] vs. 2.0 hours [interquartile range, 1.0 to 3.8], P<0.001) (Table 2). Overall, more patients in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group received a vasopressor infusion (76.3% vs. 65.8%, P<0.001), but the median duration of the infusion did not differ significantly between the two groups (29.4 hours [interquartile range, 12.9 to 61.0] and 34.2 hours [interquartile range, 14.0 to 67.0], respectively; P=0.24). There were no other significant between-group differences in secondary or tertiary outcomes. Subsidiary analyses of secondary and tertiary variables after adjustment for predefined covariates did not alter any of the reported findings (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nAdverse Events\nThere was no significant between-group difference in the number of patients with one or more adverse events: 56 patients (7.1%) in the EGDT group and 42 patients (5.3%) in the usual-care group (P=0.15). A breakdown of specific adverse events is presented in Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nDiscussion\nIn this randomized trial conducted in a variety of health care settings\n######################\nOutput:"

In a previous study, drotrecogin alfa activated produced dose-dependent reductions in the levels of markers of coagulation and inflammation in patients with severe sepsis. In this phase 3 trial, we assessed whether treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated reduced the rate of death from any cause among patients with severe sepsis.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Patients with systemic inflammation and organ failure due to acute infection were enrolled and assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of either placebo or drotrecogin alfa activated (24 μg per kilogram of body weight per hour) for a total duration of 96 hours. The prospectively defined primary end point was death from any cause and was assessed 28 days after the start of the infusion. Patients were monitored for adverse events; changes in vital signs, laboratory variables, and the results of microbiologic cultures; and the development of neutralizing antibodies against activated protein C.\nResults\nA total of 1690 randomized patients were treated (840 in the placebo group and 850 in the drotrecogin alfa activated group). The mortality rate was 30.8 percent in the placebo group and 24.7 percent in the drotrecogin alfa activated group. On the basis of the prospectively defined primary analysis, treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated was associated with a reduction in the relative risk of death of 19.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6.6 to 30.5) and an absolute reduction in the risk of death of 6.1 percent (P=0.005). The incidence of serious bleeding was higher in the drotrecogin alfa activated group than in the placebo group (3.5 percent vs. 2.0 percent, P=0.06).\nConclusions\nTreatment with drotrecogin alfa activated significantly reduces mortality in patients with severe sepsis and may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.\nSevere sepsis, defined as sepsis associated with acute organ dysfunction, results from a generalized inflammatory and procoagulant response to an infection.1 The rate of death from severe sepsis ranges from 30 to 50 percent despite advances in critical care.2–5 In the United States, approximately 750,000 cases of sepsis occur each year, at least 225,000 of which are fatal.6\nThe inflammatory and procoagulant host responses to infection are closely related.7 Inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6, are capable of activating coagulation and inhibiting fibrinolysis, whereas the procoagulant thrombin is capable of stimulating multiple inflammatory pathways.7–11 The end result may be diffuse endovascular injury, multiorgan dysfunction, and death. Activated protein C, an endogenous protein that promotes fibrinolysis and inhibits thrombosis and inflammation, is an important modulator of the coagulation and inflammation associated with severe sepsis (Figure 1).18 Activated protein C is converted from its inactive precursor, protein C, by thrombin coupled to thrombomodulin.18 The conversion of protein C to activated protein C may be impaired during sepsis as a result of the down-regulation of thrombomodulin by inflammatory cytokines.19 Reduced levels of protein C are found in the majority of patients with sepsis and are associated with an increased risk of death.20–23\nFigure 1\n\nProposed Actions of Activated Protein C in Modulating the Systemic Inflammatory, Procoagulant, and Fibrinolytic Host Responses to Infection.\nPrevious preclinical and clinical studies showed that the administration of activated protein C may improve the outcome of severe sepsis. The administration of activated protein C was protective in a baboon model of lethal Escherichia coli sepsis.24 In a placebo-controlled phase 2 trial in patients with severe sepsis, an infusion of drotrecogin alfa (activated), or recombinant human activated protein C (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis), hereafter referred to as drotrecogin alfa activated, resulted in dose-dependent reductions in the plasma levels of D-dimer and serum levels of interleukin-6, markers of coagulopathy and inflammation, respectively.25 We therefore evaluated whether the administration of drotrecogin alfa activated would reduce the rate of death from all causes at 28 days in patients with severe sepsis and have an acceptable safety profile.\nMethods\nPatients\nFrom July 1998 through June 2000, eligible patients were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, which was conducted at 164 centers in 11 countries. The institutional review board at each center approved the protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their authorized representatives. The clinical coordinating center (Vanderbilt Coordinating Center, Nashville) was available 24 hours a day throughout the study to answer investigators' questions regarding patients' eligibility and safety and the reporting of serious adverse events.\nSelection Criteria\nThe criteria for severe sepsis were a modification of those defined by Bone et al. (Appendix 1).26 Patients were eligible for the trial if they had a known or suspected infection on the basis of clinical data at the time of screening and if they met the following criteria within a 24-hour period: three or more signs of systemic inflammation and the sepsis-induced\n######################\nOutput:"

A breakdown of specific adverse events is presented in Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nDiscussion\nIn this randomized trial conducted in a variety of health care settings, we found that EGDT, as compared with usual care, did not reduce the primary outcome of 90-day all-cause mortality, either overall or in any of the prespecified subgroups, among patients with early septic shock who presented to the emergency department. There were also no significant differences in 28-day or in-hospital mortality, duration of organ support, or length of hospital stay.\nAdherence to the algorithm-directed therapies was very high, and the potentially confounding effect of the time to the administration of antimicrobial drugs was addressed by the requirement that such drugs be administered before randomization. In addition, the loss to follow-up was minimal. The statistical analysis plan was published before recruitment was completed, which eliminated the potential for analytical bias.28 Although the trial could not be blinded because of the practical requirements of EGDT, the risk of bias was minimized through central randomization, concealment of study-group assignments before randomization to avoid selection bias, and the use of a robust primary outcome that would not be subject to observer bias. The results also have a high degree of external validity, since participating sites were representative of all regions across Australia and New Zealand, including metropolitan and rural centers, with a mix of EGDT implementation models based in the emergency department, ICU, or both.\nThe rate of death in our study was lower than that reported in the original EGDT trial.11 This finding is consistent with data showing that in-hospital mortality for patients who are admitted to ICUs with severe sepsis and septic shock has been reduced by 1 percentage point per year during the past two decades, with the decline beginning before the introduction of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. 4,8,33 Although our study had entry criteria similar to those in the ProCESS study and the original EGDT trial, it is possible that the patients in our study had a reduced risk of death because of low rates of chronic disease and better functional status, as evidenced by the low proportion of nursing home residents before randomization. Nonetheless, the number of patients with septic shock at the time of enrollment was high, indicating that the target population was enrolled. The high number of patients who were discharged home may also support the small increment in mortality between hospital discharge and 90 days. There was no trend suggesting an effect of EGDT in any unadjusted or adjusted estimates of mortality, and subgroup analyses did not indicate that the benefit from EGDT increased with the severity of illness. Although contamination of the usual-care group by the incorporation of some elements of the EGDT protocol into usual care may have biased the study results, significant differences in EGDT-specific treatments that were administered in the two groups and the similarity between therapies administered in the usual-care group in this study and those in our pretrial observational study25 indicate that such an effect in the usual-care group is unlikely.\nOur findings agree with those of the ProCESS trial,10 in which investigators also used a resuscitation algorithm that was similar to that used in the original EGDT trial.11 Although our results differ from those in the original trial, they are consistent with previous studies showing that bias in small, single-center trials may lead to inflated effect sizes34 that cannot be replicated in larger, multicenter studies.35–37 Although the ProCESS study did not directly compare protocol-based EGDT for resuscitation with care that was not protocol-based, the concordance of results between our study and the ProCESS study suggests that EGDT does not offer a survival advantage in patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock. Whether resuscitation protocols with different goals or different individual therapies in the EGDT bundle offer a survival benefit remains to be determined.\nIn conclusion, the results of our trial show that EGDT, as compared with usual resuscitation practice, did not decrease mortality among patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock. Our findings suggest that the value of incorporating EGDT into international guidelines as a standard of care is questionable.\n######################\nOutput:"

ScvO2 monitors were loaned to participating sites by Edwards Lifesciences, which had no other role in the conduct of the study.\nStudy Population\nPatients 18 years of age or older who met the eligibility criteria within 6 hours after presentation to the emergency department were assessed for enrollment. Eligibility criteria were a suspected or confirmed infection, two or more criteria for a systemic inflammatory response26 (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix), and evidence of refractory hypotension or hypoperfusion. Refractory hypotension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or a mean arterial pressure of less than 65 mm Hg after an intravenous fluid challenge of 1000 ml or more administered within a 60-minute period. Hypoperfusion was defined as a blood lactate level of 4.0 mmol per liter or more. Randomization was required within 2 hours after fulfillment of the final inclusion criterion. The initiation of the first dose of intravenous antimicrobial therapy was mandated before randomization. The study exclusion criteria are provided in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix.\nRandomization\nEligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either EGDT or usual care for 6 hours. Randomization was stratified according to study center with the use of a permuted-block method and was performed by means of a centralized telephone interactive voice-response system that was accessible 24 hours a day. Because of the nature of the intervention, all patients and clinicians involved in their care were aware of study-group assignments.\nStudy Treatments\nFor patients in the usual-care group, decisions about the location of care delivery, investigations, monitoring, and all treatments were made by the treating clinical team. ScvO2 measurement was not permitted during the 6-hour intervention period. Data were collected regarding insertion of invasive monitoring devices, intravenous-fluid resuscitation, vasoactive support, red-cell transfusion, mechanical ventilation, and other supportive therapy.\nFor patients in the EGDT group, the intervention was provided by a study team trained in EGDT delivery. Both the care providers and location of delivery were dependent on local resources. Thus, investigators used EGDT implementation models based in the emergency department, the intensive care unit (ICU), or both. A multifaceted intervention was used to standardize EGDT delivery across sites.24 Details of EGDT implementation, personnel, and location are provided in Table S1 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nIn the EGDT group, an arterial catheter and a central venous catheter capable of continuous ScvO2 measurement (Edwards Lifesciences) were inserted within 1 hour after randomization. The resuscitation algorithm was based on the original EGDT algorithm11 and was followed until 6 hours after randomization (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nStudy Outcomes\nThe primary study outcome was death from any cause within 90 days after randomization. Secondary and tertiary outcomes included survival time from randomization to 90 days; mortality in the ICU; mortality at 28 days; in-hospital mortality at 60 days; cause-specific mortality at 90 days27; length of stay in the emergency department, ICU, or elsewhere in the hospital; receipt and duration of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, or renal-replacement therapy; destination at the time of discharge (for surviving inpatients); limitation of therapy (e.g., do-not-resuscitate order) at the time of death (for nonsurvivors); and adverse events.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses were conducted according to a statistical analysis plan that was reported previously.28 The sample-size calculation was based on an assumed in-hospital rate of death in the usual-care group of 28%,25,29 with an increment of 10 percentage points (38%) for the rate of death at 90 days.8,30 Thus, an enrollment of 1600 patients would have a power of 85 to 90% (at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05) to detect an absolute risk reduction of 7.6 percentage points (or a relative risk reduction of 20%) in the EGDT group, with allowance for a plausible range of loss to follow-up. One interim analysis was planned and performed after the enrollment of 50% of the patients, with the use of a two-sided, symmetric O'Brien–Fleming design and a two-sided P value of 0.005; this analysis was reviewed by the independent data and safety monitoring committee.\nAll analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. No assumptions were made for missing or unavailable data. We report continuous variables as means (±SD) or medians and interquartile ranges, and categorical variables as proportions. We used Student's t-test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to analyze between-group differences, as appropriate. Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables, including the primary outcome. Absolute and relative risk differences with 95% confidence intervals for all-cause mortality at 90 days are reported. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed with the use of multivariable logistic regression adjusted for predefined baseline covariates: country, age, score on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), systolic blood pressure (<90 mm Hg or ≥90 mm Hg\n######################\nOutput:"

The distribution of ICU-free days according to study group is shown in Figure S7 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nTable 2\n\nStudy Outcomes.\nSecondary Outcomes\nThere were no significant differences between the acetaminophen group and the placebo group with respect to mortality at day 28 or at day 90 (Table 2, and Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix) or with respect to survival time to day 90 (Figure 2). A total of 55 of 345 patients (15.9%) assigned to acetaminophen and 57 of 344 patients (16.6%) assigned to placebo had died by 90 days (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.39; P=0.84).\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan–Meier Estimates of the Probability of Survival to Day 90.\nThere was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to ICU length of stay (4.1 days [interquartile range, 2.1 to 8.3] among patients assigned to acetaminophen and 4.2 days [interquartile range, 2.0 to 9.0] among patients assigned to placebo; absolute difference, −0.1 days; 95% CI, −0.7 to 0.4; P=0.65) or with respect to hospital length of stay (13.7 days [interquartile range, 7.6 to 22.9] among patients assigned to acetaminophen and 13.8 days [interquartile range, 7.1 to 24.3] among patients assigned to placebo; absolute difference, −0.01 days; 95% CI, −1.6 to 1.6; P=0.98). There was heterogeneity of response, with acetaminophen associated with a shorter median ICU length of stay than placebo among survivors (3.5 days [interquartile range, 1.9 to 6.9] vs. 4.3 days [interquartile range, 2.1 to 8.9], P=0.01) and with a longer median ICU length of stay among nonsurvivors (10.4 days [interquartile range, 4.1 to 16.9] vs. 4.0 days [interquartile range, 1.7 to 9.4], P<0.001) (P<0.001 for interaction) (Table 3).\nTable 3\n\nLogarithmic Transformation Analysis of ICU and Hospital Length of Stay among Survivors versus Nonsurvivors.\nThere were no significant differences between the study groups with respect to any other secondary outcome variables (Table 2). There was no significant heterogeneity in study-drug effect on ICU-free days in any of the prespecified subgroups (Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nAdverse Events\nLiver dysfunction led to discontinuation of the study drug in 28 of 347 patients (8.1%) assigned to acetaminophen and in 34 of 344 patients (9.9%) assigned to placebo (odds ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.16; P=0.40). There was a serious adverse event of markedly elevated body temperature associated with death in 1 patient assigned to placebo (see the Supplementary Appendix).\nDiscussion\nIn this binational, blinded, randomized, controlled trial, we observed that the early administration of acetaminophen for treatment of fever in adult ICU patients with probable infection resulted in neither more ICU-free days nor fewer ICU-free days than those observed with administration of placebo. Although acetaminophen was associated with a shorter ICU stay than placebo among survivors and a longer stay among nonsurvivors, there was no significant difference between the acetaminophen group and the placebo group with respect to 28-day mortality, 90-day mortality, or survival time to day 90.

Secondary end points were time until development of septic shock or death (whichever came first), mortality in the ICU and hospital, vital status at 28, 90, and 180 days, duration of stay in the ICU and hospital, organ dysfunctions (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score, ranging from 0-24 with higher values indicating greater severity), duration of mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. In the subgroup of patients who underwent a corticotropin test at baseline, the occurrence of septic shock, mortality, length of stay (LOS) in the ICU or hospital, mechanical ventilation, organ dysfunctions (SOFA score), renal replacement therapy, and secondary infection were evaluated. Critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency was defined as an increase of cortisol of 9 µg/dL or less (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 27.588) 1 hour after stimulation with 250 µg of corticotropin (Synacthen). Frequency of delirium was assessed daily until ICU discharge by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale18,19 (ranging from −5 [unarousable; no response to voice or physical stimulation] to 4 [combative; overly combative or violent; immediate danger to staff]) to quantify the level of sedation and by the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU for detection of delirium. Adverse events were assessed until day 28, with special emphasis on muscle weakness, weaning failure, secondary infection, and gastrointestinal bleeding. All events not typically associated with the course of disease had to be reported (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1).\n\nData Acquisition, Cortisol Measurement, and Patient Treatment\nDisease severity was assessed by the SOFA score,20 Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (ranging from 0-163),21 Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (ranging from 0-71),22 and Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (ranging from 0-217) (with higher scores indicating greater severity on all instruments).23 Serum cortisol concentration was batch analyzed by mass spectrometry in a reference laboratory in blood samples stored at −80°C and taken before and 60 minutes after administration of 250 µg of corticotropin at baseline. All patients had to be treated according to guidelines of the German Sepsis Society13 (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nThe study was planned to detect an absolute difference of 15% in the proportion of patients with septic shock within 14 days with a significance level of .05 and a power of 0.8. The difference of 15% was postulated to be a meaningful difference that could change clinical practice, and was supported by similar differences of hydrocortisone on 7-day septic shock resolution in patients with septic shock,24 assuming that hydrocortisone might be as effective in preventing septic shock as in resolving it.\n\nAssuming 40% of patients in the placebo group had septic shock,8,25-27 169 evaluable patients per arm were required. Accounting for an expected dropout rate of about 10%, 190 patients per arm (380 in total) had to be included. The statistical analysis was conducted consistent with the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. The primary end point was assessed by χ2 test; heterogeneity between centers with more than 10 recruited patients was assessed by I2. Secondary end points were analyzed by χ2 test, Fisher exact test, t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or log-rank test, as appropriate. All reported P values are 2-sided, and P < .05 was regarded as statistically significant. Secondary analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing because these statistical comparisons were performed with exploratory rather than confirmatory intention. Planned subgroup analyses included the ITT population and the per-protocol (PP) population, administration of study medication for at least 48 hours, medical and surgical patients, and patients with pneumonia. Post hoc subgroup analyses were performed for CIRCI, delirium, and CAP. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to investigate adjusted treatment effects. Two interim analyses were performed after recruitment of one-third and two-thirds of the planned sample size. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc), R version 3.1.0 (R Foundation), and SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp) statistical software. For details of the statistical analyses, see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1.\n\nResults\nPatient Population\nFrom January 13, 2009, to August 27, 2013, 9953 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were screened at 34 study sites for eligibility. A total of 380 patients were randomized to receive hydrocortisone (n = 190) or placebo (n = 190). The median time from screening to enrollment was 12.5 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 6-21 hours)\n######################\nOutput:"

Secondary end points were time until development of septic shock or death (whichever came first), mortality in the ICU and hospital, vital status at 28, 90, and 180 days, duration of stay in the ICU and hospital, organ dysfunctions (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score, ranging from 0-24 with higher values indicating greater severity), duration of mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. In the subgroup of patients who underwent a corticotropin test at baseline, the occurrence of septic shock, mortality, length of stay (LOS) in the ICU or hospital, mechanical ventilation, organ dysfunctions (SOFA score), renal replacement therapy, and secondary infection were evaluated. Critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency was defined as an increase of cortisol of 9 µg/dL or less (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 27.588) 1 hour after stimulation with 250 µg of corticotropin (Synacthen). Frequency of delirium was assessed daily until ICU discharge by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale18,19 (ranging from −5 [unarousable; no response to voice or physical stimulation] to 4 [combative; overly combative or violent; immediate danger to staff]) to quantify the level of sedation and by the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU for detection of delirium. Adverse events were assessed until day 28, with special emphasis on muscle weakness, weaning failure, secondary infection, and gastrointestinal bleeding. All events not typically associated with the course of disease had to be reported (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1).\n\nData Acquisition, Cortisol Measurement, and Patient Treatment\nDisease severity was assessed by the SOFA score,20 Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (ranging from 0-163),21 Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (ranging from 0-71),22 and Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (ranging from 0-217) (with higher scores indicating greater severity on all instruments).23 Serum cortisol concentration was batch analyzed by mass spectrometry in a reference laboratory in blood samples stored at −80°C and taken before and 60 minutes after administration of 250 µg of corticotropin at baseline. All patients had to be treated according to guidelines of the German Sepsis Society13 (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nThe study was planned to detect an absolute difference of 15% in the proportion of patients with septic shock within 14 days with a significance level of .05 and a power of 0.8. The difference of 15% was postulated to be a meaningful difference that could change clinical practice, and was supported by similar differences of hydrocortisone on 7-day septic shock resolution in patients with septic shock,24 assuming that hydrocortisone might be as effective in preventing septic shock as in resolving it.\n\nAssuming 40% of patients in the placebo group had septic shock,8,25-27 169 evaluable patients per arm were required. Accounting for an expected dropout rate of about 10%, 190 patients per arm (380 in total) had to be included. The statistical analysis was conducted consistent with the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. The primary end point was assessed by χ2 test; heterogeneity between centers with more than 10 recruited patients was assessed by I2. Secondary end points were analyzed by χ2 test, Fisher exact test, t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or log-rank test, as appropriate. All reported P values are 2-sided, and P < .05 was regarded as statistically significant. Secondary analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing because these statistical comparisons were performed with exploratory rather than confirmatory intention. Planned subgroup analyses included the ITT population and the per-protocol (PP) population, administration of study medication for at least 48 hours, medical and surgical patients, and patients with pneumonia. Post hoc subgroup analyses were performed for CIRCI, delirium, and CAP. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to investigate adjusted treatment effects. Two interim analyses were performed after recruitment of one-third and two-thirds of the planned sample size. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc), R version 3.1.0 (R Foundation), and SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp) statistical software. For details of the statistical analyses, see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1.\n\nResults\nPatient Population\nFrom January 13, 2009, to August 27, 2013, 9953 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were screened at 34 study sites for eligibility. A total of 380 patients were randomized to receive hydrocortisone (n = 190) or placebo (n = 190). The median time from screening to enrollment was 12.5 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 6-21 hours)"

A key difference was our use of lighter sedation targets in the control group to be consistent with current practice recommendations.6,8,9 To minimize potentially confounding differences in the use of cointerventions, we specified the approach to mechanical ventilation in the protocol, including the use of a strategy involving a high PEEP, and we recommended the use of a conservative fluid strategy.16-18 To capture potential differences in late sequelae, assessors who were unaware of the group assignment interviewed surviving patients or their proxies at 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization. We published the protocol and submitted the statistical analysis plan (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) to the NHLBI before data analysis.15 A central institutional review board and a data and safety monitoring board appointed by the NHLBI provided oversight. Our coordinating center gathered and analyzed the data, and the protocol committee wrote the first draft of the manuscript. We vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. We obtained written informed consent from representatives of all patients.\nPatients\nWe enrolled patients who were undergoing mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube and had the following criteria present for less than 48 hours: Pao2:Fio2 of less than 150 mm Hg with a PEEP of 8 cm or more of water; bilateral pulmonary opacities on chest radiography or on computed tomography that could not be explained by effusions, pulmonary collapse, or nodules; and respiratory failure that could not be explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. If results of arterial blood gas analysis were unavailable, the Pao2 was inferred from the oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2) and was used to estimate the Pao2:Fio2 at a PEEP of 8 cm or more of water.19,20 A full list of exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.\nRandomization and Treatments\nWe randomly assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive 48 hours of continuous neuromuscular blockade with concomitant deep sedation (intervention group) or to receive usual care without routine neuromuscular blockade and with lighter sedation targets (control group). Patients in the intervention group who were not under deep sedation at baseline were deeply sedated within 4 hours after randomization. Subsequently, patients in this group received an intravenous bolus of 15 mg of cisatracurium, followed by a continuous infusion of 37.5 mg per hour for 48 hours. Although treatment was not administered in a blinded manner, we chose not to adjust the dose of the neuromuscular blocking agent according to peripheral nerve stimulation both to replicate the dosing regimen used in the ACURASYS trial and to facilitate adherence to the trial protocol. Neuromuscular blockade could be stopped early if the patient met the criteria for freedom from mechanical ventilation (Fio2 ≤0.40 and PEEP ≤8 cm of water) for at least 12 hours. We recommended the use of light sedation in the control group. Light sedation was defined by a score on the Richmond Agitation–Sedation Scale of 0 or −1 (scores range from 4 [combative] to −5 [unresponsive], with a score of 0 indicating that the patient is alert and calm), a score on the Riker Sedation–Agitation Scale of 3 or 4 (scores range from 1 [unresponsive] to 7 [dangerous agitation], with a score of 4 indicating that the patient is calm and cooperative), or a score on the Ramsay Sedation Scale of 2 or 3 (scores range from 1 [anxious, restless] to 6 [unresponsive], with a score of 2 indicating that the patient is cooperative and oriented).21-23\nCommon Trial Procedures\nAll patients were treated with a strategy of low tidal volume ventilation within 2 hours after randomization and a high PEEP strategy for up to 5 days after randomization.16,24,25 We allowed a lower PEEP if the clinician suspected that a higher PEEP worsened oxygenation, hypotension, high plateau pressures (>30 cm of water), or acidemia (pH <7.15) despite tidal-volume reductions, fluid boluses, or increases in respiratory rate. Lower PEEP was also permitted if a pneumothorax developed or if the patient was at high risk for barotrauma. The use of prone positioning was at the discretion of the clinician, though we recommended that clinicians wait at least 12 hours after the onset of ARDS, as suggested by current evidence,26 and avoid the automatic use of neuromuscular blockade. We allowed an open-label intravenous bolus injection of 20 mg of cisatracurium in both groups if patients met prespecified criteria (see the Additional Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix). After the 48-hour trial intervention period, decisions regarding further use of neuromuscular blockade, including the choice of agent, were left to the discretion of the treating clinician. To facilitate comparison, we report all neuromuscular blockade use as the equivalent cisatracurium dose.27\nEnd Points\nThe primary end point was in-hospital death from any cause at 90 days (in-hospital was defined as the time in the trial hospital plus transfer to another hospital, including the time in long-term acute care facilities). Secondary end points were organ dysfunction (\n######################\nOutput:"

A key difference was our use of lighter sedation targets in the control group to be consistent with current practice recommendations.6,8,9 To minimize potentially confounding differences in the use of cointerventions, we specified the approach to mechanical ventilation in the protocol, including the use of a strategy involving a high PEEP, and we recommended the use of a conservative fluid strategy.16-18 To capture potential differences in late sequelae, assessors who were unaware of the group assignment interviewed surviving patients or their proxies at 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization. We published the protocol and submitted the statistical analysis plan (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) to the NHLBI before data analysis.15 A central institutional review board and a data and safety monitoring board appointed by the NHLBI provided oversight. Our coordinating center gathered and analyzed the data, and the protocol committee wrote the first draft of the manuscript. We vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. We obtained written informed consent from representatives of all patients.\nPatients\nWe enrolled patients who were undergoing mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube and had the following criteria present for less than 48 hours: Pao2:Fio2 of less than 150 mm Hg with a PEEP of 8 cm or more of water; bilateral pulmonary opacities on chest radiography or on computed tomography that could not be explained by effusions, pulmonary collapse, or nodules; and respiratory failure that could not be explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. If results of arterial blood gas analysis were unavailable, the Pao2 was inferred from the oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2) and was used to estimate the Pao2:Fio2 at a PEEP of 8 cm or more of water.19,20 A full list of exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.\nRandomization and Treatments\nWe randomly assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive 48 hours of continuous neuromuscular blockade with concomitant deep sedation (intervention group) or to receive usual care without routine neuromuscular blockade and with lighter sedation targets (control group). Patients in the intervention group who were not under deep sedation at baseline were deeply sedated within 4 hours after randomization. Subsequently, patients in this group received an intravenous bolus of 15 mg of cisatracurium, followed by a continuous infusion of 37.5 mg per hour for 48 hours. Although treatment was not administered in a blinded manner, we chose not to adjust the dose of the neuromuscular blocking agent according to peripheral nerve stimulation both to replicate the dosing regimen used in the ACURASYS trial and to facilitate adherence to the trial protocol. Neuromuscular blockade could be stopped early if the patient met the criteria for freedom from mechanical ventilation (Fio2 ≤0.40 and PEEP ≤8 cm of water) for at least 12 hours. We recommended the use of light sedation in the control group. Light sedation was defined by a score on the Richmond Agitation–Sedation Scale of 0 or −1 (scores range from 4 [combative] to −5 [unresponsive], with a score of 0 indicating that the patient is alert and calm), a score on the Riker Sedation–Agitation Scale of 3 or 4 (scores range from 1 [unresponsive] to 7 [dangerous agitation], with a score of 4 indicating that the patient is calm and cooperative), or a score on the Ramsay Sedation Scale of 2 or 3 (scores range from 1 [anxious, restless] to 6 [unresponsive], with a score of 2 indicating that the patient is cooperative and oriented).21-23\nCommon Trial Procedures\nAll patients were treated with a strategy of low tidal volume ventilation within 2 hours after randomization and a high PEEP strategy for up to 5 days after randomization.16,24,25 We allowed a lower PEEP if the clinician suspected that a higher PEEP worsened oxygenation, hypotension, high plateau pressures (>30 cm of water), or acidemia (pH <7.15) despite tidal-volume reductions, fluid boluses, or increases in respiratory rate. Lower PEEP was also permitted if a pneumothorax developed or if the patient was at high risk for barotrauma. The use of prone positioning was at the discretion of the clinician, though we recommended that clinicians wait at least 12 hours after the onset of ARDS, as suggested by current evidence,26 and avoid the automatic use of neuromuscular blockade. We allowed an open-label intravenous bolus injection of 20 mg of cisatracurium in both groups if patients met prespecified criteria (see the Additional Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix). After the 48-hour trial intervention period, decisions regarding further use of neuromuscular blockade, including the choice of agent, were left to the discretion of the treating clinician. To facilitate comparison, we report all neuromuscular blockade use as the equivalent cisatracurium dose.27\nEnd Points\nThe primary end point was in-hospital death from any cause at 90 days (in-hospital was defined as the time in the trial hospital plus transfer to another hospital, including the time in long-term acute care facilities). Secondary end points were organ dysfunction ("

The proportion of deaths after withdrawal of life support was similar in the two groups (55% [71 of 129 patients] in the HFOV group and 49% [47 of 96 patients] in the control group, P=0.12). The rate of new-onset barotrauma was higher in the HFOV group than in the control group, but the difference was not significant (18% and 13%, respectively; P=0.13). Among survivors, the duration of ventilation and the length of stay in the ICU were similar in the two groups (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nThe main finding of this multicenter, randomized trial is that among patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, early application of HFOV was associated with higher mortality than was a ventilation strategy that used small tidal volumes and high PEEP levels, with HFOV used only in patients with severe refractory hypoxemia. HFOV was associated with higher mean airway pressures and with greater use of sedatives, neuromuscular blockers, and vasoactive drugs.\nWe stopped the trial early on the basis of a strong signal for increased mortality with HFOV, even though the prespecified stopping thresholds had not been reached. Studies that are stopped early on the basis of harm (or benefit) typically overestimate the magnitude of effect.31 We chose to terminate the study for three reasons: there was a consistent finding of increased mortality with HFOV in three consecutive analyses that were conducted after enrollment of 94, 300, and 500 patients; the increased need for vasoactive drugs in the HFOV group suggested a mechanism of harm that was not offset by better oxygenation and lung recruitment; and the effect size was sufficiently large that we concluded that even if early HFOV did not increase mortality, it would be very unlikely to decrease mortality. We believe that continued enrollment would have put patients at risk with little likelihood of benefit.\nOur results are inconsistent with the physiological rationale for HFOV and with the results of studies in animals. In studies in animals in which benefits of HFOV were observed, lung injury was induced with the use of saline lavage — a highly recruitable model of surfactant deficiency — which our results suggest does not translate directly to human adults with ARDS, in whom recruitability can be heterogeneous.32 Our results also contrast with those of prior randomized trials involving adults.22 A possible explanation, which provided motivation for our trial, is that prior studies used control ventilation strategies that are now known to be potentially harmful.20,21 We found no benefit with HFOV when a current ventilation strategy was used as a control. This finding of no benefit with respect to mortality is consistent with the results of another trial now reported in the Journal; in that trial, conducted in the United Kingdom, current standards for lung protection were suggested but not mandated.33 More surprising was our finding of harm. Several plausible mechanisms may contribute to increased mortality with HFOV. Higher mean airway pressures may result in hemodynamic compromise by decreasing venous return or directly affecting right ventricular function.34 Increased use of vasodilating sedative agents may also contribute to hemodynamic compromise. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility of increased barotrauma in association with HFOV.\nThe HFOV strategy that we chose, which was supported by preclinical data15,16 and a prospective physiological study,24 aimed to adjust mean airway pressure on the deflation limb of the volume-pressure curve and use the highest frequency possible to limit oscillatory volumes. This approach led to relatively high mean airway pressures, even considering that when mean airway pressures are delivered with a ratio of inspiratory-to-expiratory time of 1:2, as in our study, the pressures measured at the airway opening during HFOV are somewhat higher than those measured in the trachea.35–37 It is possible that an HFOV protocol that uses lower mean airway pressures, a different ratio of inspiratory-to-expiratory time, or a lower oscillatory frequency might have led to different results.\nThe strengths of this trial include its methodologic rigor, the application of protocols designed to open lung units in patients in both groups on the basis of the best available evidence, and enrollment at centers in several countries, which enhances the generalizability of our findings. Because we were cognizant that there is a learning curve associated with the use of HFOV,38,39 we enrolled most patients at centers that were experienced with HFOV, and we did not detect an interaction between treatment effect and the number of enrolled patients per site.\nOur results raise serious concerns about the early use of HFOV for the management of ARDS in adults. The results of this study increase the uncertainty about possible benefits of HFOV even when applied in patients with life-threatening refractory hypoxemia.\nIn conclusion, in adults with moderate-to-severe ARDS, the early application of HFOV targeting lung recruitment — as compared with a ventilation strategy that uses\n######################\nOutput:"

The proportion of deaths after withdrawal of life support was similar in the two groups (55% [71 of 129 patients] in the HFOV group and 49% [47 of 96 patients] in the control group, P=0.12). The rate of new-onset barotrauma was higher in the HFOV group than in the control group, but the difference was not significant (18% and 13%, respectively; P=0.13). Among survivors, the duration of ventilation and the length of stay in the ICU were similar in the two groups (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nThe main finding of this multicenter, randomized trial is that among patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, early application of HFOV was associated with higher mortality than was a ventilation strategy that used small tidal volumes and high PEEP levels, with HFOV used only in patients with severe refractory hypoxemia. HFOV was associated with higher mean airway pressures and with greater use of sedatives, neuromuscular blockers, and vasoactive drugs.\nWe stopped the trial early on the basis of a strong signal for increased mortality with HFOV, even though the prespecified stopping thresholds had not been reached. Studies that are stopped early on the basis of harm (or benefit) typically overestimate the magnitude of effect.31 We chose to terminate the study for three reasons: there was a consistent finding of increased mortality with HFOV in three consecutive analyses that were conducted after enrollment of 94, 300, and 500 patients; the increased need for vasoactive drugs in the HFOV group suggested a mechanism of harm that was not offset by better oxygenation and lung recruitment; and the effect size was sufficiently large that we concluded that even if early HFOV did not increase mortality, it would be very unlikely to decrease mortality. We believe that continued enrollment would have put patients at risk with little likelihood of benefit.\nOur results are inconsistent with the physiological rationale for HFOV and with the results of studies in animals. In studies in animals in which benefits of HFOV were observed, lung injury was induced with the use of saline lavage — a highly recruitable model of surfactant deficiency — which our results suggest does not translate directly to human adults with ARDS, in whom recruitability can be heterogeneous.32 Our results also contrast with those of prior randomized trials involving adults.22 A possible explanation, which provided motivation for our trial, is that prior studies used control ventilation strategies that are now known to be potentially harmful.20,21 We found no benefit with HFOV when a current ventilation strategy was used as a control. This finding of no benefit with respect to mortality is consistent with the results of another trial now reported in the Journal; in that trial, conducted in the United Kingdom, current standards for lung protection were suggested but not mandated.33 More surprising was our finding of harm. Several plausible mechanisms may contribute to increased mortality with HFOV. Higher mean airway pressures may result in hemodynamic compromise by decreasing venous return or directly affecting right ventricular function.34 Increased use of vasodilating sedative agents may also contribute to hemodynamic compromise. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility of increased barotrauma in association with HFOV.\nThe HFOV strategy that we chose, which was supported by preclinical data15,16 and a prospective physiological study,24 aimed to adjust mean airway pressure on the deflation limb of the volume-pressure curve and use the highest frequency possible to limit oscillatory volumes. This approach led to relatively high mean airway pressures, even considering that when mean airway pressures are delivered with a ratio of inspiratory-to-expiratory time of 1:2, as in our study, the pressures measured at the airway opening during HFOV are somewhat higher than those measured in the trachea.35–37 It is possible that an HFOV protocol that uses lower mean airway pressures, a different ratio of inspiratory-to-expiratory time, or a lower oscillatory frequency might have led to different results.\nThe strengths of this trial include its methodologic rigor, the application of protocols designed to open lung units in patients in both groups on the basis of the best available evidence, and enrollment at centers in several countries, which enhances the generalizability of our findings. Because we were cognizant that there is a learning curve associated with the use of HFOV,38,39 we enrolled most patients at centers that were experienced with HFOV, and we did not detect an interaction between treatment effect and the number of enrolled patients per site.\nOur results raise serious concerns about the early use of HFOV for the management of ARDS in adults. The results of this study increase the uncertainty about possible benefits of HFOV even when applied in patients with life-threatening refractory hypoxemia.\nIn conclusion, in adults with moderate-to-severe ARDS, the early application of HFOV targeting lung recruitment — as compared with a ventilation strategy that uses"

The overall effect of treatment did not differ significantly among these subgroups (P=0.87 for interaction), although the rate of death at 28 days was significantly higher among patients with cardiogenic shock who were treated with dopamine than among those with cardiogenic shock who were treated with norepinephrine (P=0.03) (Figure 3). The Kaplan–Meier curves for the subgroup analysis according to type of shock are shown in Figure 7 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nFigure 3\n\nForest Plot for Predefined Subgroup Analysis According to Type of Shock.\nDiscussion\nIn this multicenter, randomized, blinded trial comparing dopamine and norepinephrine as the initial vasopressor therapy in the treatment of shock, there was no significant difference in the rate of death at 28 days between patients who received dopamine and those who received norepinephrine. Dopamine was associated with more arrhythmic events than was norepinephrine, and arrhythmic events that were severe enough to require withdrawal from the study were more frequent in the dopamine group. In addition, dopamine was associated with a significant increase in the rate of death in the predefined subgroup of patients with cardiogenic shock.\nThe rate of death at 28 days in this study was close to 50%, which is to be expected in a study with very few exclusion criteria and is similar to the rate in previous observational studies.3,9,21–24 Our trial was a pragmatic study that included all patients who were treated for shock states, and therefore, it has high external validity. The study design allowed for maximal exposure to the study drug, since we included patients who had received open-label vasopressors for a maximum of 4 hours before randomization and since during the 28-day study period, the study drug was withdrawn last when patients were weaned from vasopressor therapies and was resumed first if resumption of vasopressor therapy was necessary.\nSmaller observational studies have suggested that treatment with dopamine may be detrimental to patients with septic shock.3,9,10 However, Póvoa et al. reported a lower rate of death among patients treated with dopamine than among those treated with norepinephrine.25 In our study, which included more than 1000 patients with septic shock, there was no significant difference in the outcome between patients treated with dopamine and those treated with norepinephrine.\nAmong patients with cardiogenic shock, the rate of death was significantly higher in the group treated with dopamine than in the group treated with norepinephrine, although one might expect that cardiac output would be better maintained with dopamine26–28 than with norepinephrine. The exact cause of the increased mortality cannot be determined, but the early difference in the rate of death suggests that the higher heart rate with dopamine may have contributed to the occurrence of ischemic events. Whatever the mechanism may be, these data strongly challenge the current American College of Cardiology–American Heart Association guidelines, which recommend dopamine as the first-choice agent to increase arterial pressure among patients who have hypotension as a result of an acute myocardial infarction.7\nThis study has several limitations. First, dopamine is a less potent vasopressor than norepinephrine; however, we used infusion rates that were roughly equipotent with respect to systemic arterial pressure, and there were only minor differences in the use of open-label norepinephrine, most of which were related to early termination of the study drug and a shift to open-label norepinephrine because of the occurrence of arrhythmias that were difficult to control. Doses of open-label norepinephrine and the use of open-label epinephrine and vasopressin were similar between the two groups. Second, we used a sequential design, which potentially allowed us to stop the study early if an effect larger than that expected from observational trials occurred; however, the trial was eventually stopped after inclusion of more patients than we had expected to be included on the basis of our estimates of the sample size. Accordingly, all conclusions related to the primary outcome reached the predefined power.\nIn summary, although the rate of death did not differ significantly between the group of patients treated with dopamine and the group treated with norepinephrine, this study raises serious concerns about the safety of dopamine therapy, since dopamine, as compared with norepinephrine, was associated with more arrhythmias and with an increased rate of death in the subgroup of patients with cardiogenic shock.\nNotes\nSupported in part by the European Society of Intensive Care through support from the European Critical Care Research Network.\nDr. Aldecoa reports receiving consulting fees from Covidien.\nNo other potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary Appendix (nejm_de_backer_779sa1.pdf)\nDownload\n705.35 KB\nAppendix\nOther investigators and participants in the trial are as follows: R.

In addition, dopamine was associated with a significant increase in the rate of death in the predefined subgroup of patients with cardiogenic shock.\nThe rate of death at 28 days in this study was close to 50%, which is to be expected in a study with very few exclusion criteria and is similar to the rate in previous observational studies.3,9,21–24 Our trial was a pragmatic study that included all patients who were treated for shock states, and therefore, it has high external validity. The study design allowed for maximal exposure to the study drug, since we included patients who had received open-label vasopressors for a maximum of 4 hours before randomization and since during the 28-day study period, the study drug was withdrawn last when patients were weaned from vasopressor therapies and was resumed first if resumption of vasopressor therapy was necessary.\nSmaller observational studies have suggested that treatment with dopamine may be detrimental to patients with septic shock.3,9,10 However, Póvoa et al. reported a lower rate of death among patients treated with dopamine than among those treated with norepinephrine.25 In our study, which included more than 1000 patients with septic shock, there was no significant difference in the outcome between patients treated with dopamine and those treated with norepinephrine.\nAmong patients with cardiogenic shock, the rate of death was significantly higher in the group treated with dopamine than in the group treated with norepinephrine, although one might expect that cardiac output would be better maintained with dopamine26–28 than with norepinephrine. The exact cause of the increased mortality cannot be determined, but the early difference in the rate of death suggests that the higher heart rate with dopamine may have contributed to the occurrence of ischemic events. Whatever the mechanism may be, these data strongly challenge the current American College of Cardiology–American Heart Association guidelines, which recommend dopamine as the first-choice agent to increase arterial pressure among patients who have hypotension as a result of an acute myocardial infarction.7\nThis study has several limitations. First, dopamine is a less potent vasopressor than norepinephrine; however, we used infusion rates that were roughly equipotent with respect to systemic arterial pressure, and there were only minor differences in the use of open-label norepinephrine, most of which were related to early termination of the study drug and a shift to open-label norepinephrine because of the occurrence of arrhythmias that were difficult to control. Doses of open-label norepinephrine and the use of open-label epinephrine and vasopressin were similar between the two groups. Second, we used a sequential design, which potentially allowed us to stop the study early if an effect larger than that expected from observational trials occurred; however, the trial was eventually stopped after inclusion of more patients than we had expected to be included on the basis of our estimates of the sample size. Accordingly, all conclusions related to the primary outcome reached the predefined power.\nIn summary, although the rate of death did not differ significantly between the group of patients treated with dopamine and the group treated with norepinephrine, this study raises serious concerns about the safety of dopamine therapy, since dopamine, as compared with norepinephrine, was associated with more arrhythmias and with an increased rate of death in the subgroup of patients with cardiogenic shock.\nNotes\nSupported in part by the European Society of Intensive Care through support from the European Critical Care Research Network.\nDr. Aldecoa reports receiving consulting fees from Covidien.\nNo other potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary Appendix (nejm_de_backer_779sa1.pdf)\nDownload\n705.35 KB\nAppendix\nOther investigators and participants in the trial are as follows: R.

However, there were no differences thereafter, nor were there differences in total SOFA scores or other organ-specific SOFA scores. The use of adjunctive therapies appeared to be similar in the two groups during the 48-hour intervention period (between-group difference, 0.7 percentage points; 95% CI, −4.0 to 5.5) and through day 28 (between-group difference, 1.2 percentage points; 95% CI, −4.2 to 6.6). Overall, prone positioning was used in 15.8% of patients (159 patients), with similar use in the two groups (between-group difference, 1.9 percentage points; 95% CI, −2.6 to 6.4). Most (56% [42 patients]) of the 75 patients who underwent prone positioning in the control group did not receive concomitant neuromuscular blockade. Glucocorticoid use was also similar in the two groups. The mean (±SE) estimated mortality at 1 year was also not different between groups (51.1±2.2% in the intervention group and 51.1±2.2% in the control group). Patient-reported outcomes were similar between the groups at 3, 6, and 12 months, including health-related scores and health-related limitations with respect to disability, cognitive function, symptoms resembling those of post-traumatic stress, and pain. Additional information on secondary end points is provided in Tables S16 through S23 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nSafety and Adverse Events\nSafety and adverse events are summarized in Table 2 and in Tables S24 through S28 in the Supplementary Appendix. Although mortality was high in both groups, only one death was considered possibly related to cisatracurium, no deaths were considered probably or definitely related to cisatracurium, and there were no between-group differences in the percentage of patients who died during the 48-hour trial intervention period or up to 96 hours. Recall of paralysis was uncommon and did not differ between groups. Patients in the control group had higher mean levels of physical activity up to day 6. The rates of ICU-acquired weakness assessed were not different between groups, but many patients (range, 51.2 to 67.5%) could not complete the weekly in-hospital assessments of muscle strength. More serious cardiovascular events were reported in the intervention group than in the control group (14 vs. 4 events; P=0.02), although the rates of new-onset atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia did not differ between groups. Rates of pneumothorax and overall barotrauma also did not differ between groups.\nDiscussion\nIn a cohort of critically ill patients identified shortly after the diagnosis of moderate-to-severe ARDS, the addition of early continuous neuromuscular blockade with concomitant deep sedation did not result in lower mortality than a usual-care approach to mechanical ventilation that included lighter sedation targets. This trial had high adherence to the protocol, including minimal crossover use of neuromuscular blockade and high adherence to the recommended ventilation and fluid strategy. The results of prespecified subgroup analyses were consistent with those of the primary analysis across severity and duration of ARDS and across trial sites with different exclusion rates for previous neuromuscular blockade use.\nSeveral factors may explain why our findings differed from those of ACURASYS, the previous multicenter trial that showed a benefit with early continuous neuromuscular blockade. First, we used a higher PEEP strategy in both groups to test our intervention in the context of best care and to reduce the likelihood of differential PEEP use across groups. Higher PEEP may itself reduce mortality among patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, thereby blunting the potential treatment effect of early continuous neuromuscular blockade.16 Second, on the basis of current guideline recommendations and clinical studies,10–12,15 we designed this trial so that the sedation targets used in the control group were lighter than those used in the ACURASYS trial; deep sedation was used in both the intervention group and the control group in the ACURASYS trial. In our trial, the higher number of cardiovascular adverse events in the intervention group than in the control group could be the result of deep sedation in the intervention group, which could have induced hypotension, bradycardia, and other cardiovascular effects. Therefore, the use of the lighter sedation strategy in our control group may have decreased mortality in that group. Third, prone positioning reduces the risk of death in patients with ARDS when it is initiated during the first 12 to 24 hours after the onset of moderate-to-severe ARDS and is administered for at least 16 hours per day.26 The percentage of patients who underwent prone positioning in our trial was similar to that observed in a recent international epidemiologic study, but it was lower than in the ACURASYS trial.5,7 Whether early continuous neuromuscular blockade is more effective with prone positioning is unknown, but it is a possible explanation for the different results of our trial and the ACURASYS trial.\nPatients in our trial were enrolled earlier after the onset of ARDS than those in the ACURASYS trial.42 Consequently, we may have included patients who might not have survived long enough to be included in the previous trial. Although we excluded patients whose Pao2:Fio2 improved to more than 200 mm Hg before randomization, we may also have recruited some patients with lung injury that was either rapidly improving or less established than that observed in the previous trial. However, analyses stratified according to the time from the onset of ARDS to enrollment did not suggest any between-group difference in the rate of improvement in oxygenation or treatment\n######################\nOutput:"

First, hydrocortisone in septic shock showed conflicting results in terms of mortality, but consistent hemodynamic effects and faster septic shock resolution.6,24 Second, administration of hydrocortisone was associated with immunomodulatory effects including reduced inducible nitric oxide formation—a key mediator of septic shock pathophysiology.17 Thus, it was hypothesized that attenuation of inflammation in early severe sepsis could prevent progression to shock. Third, this hypothesis was supported by data of Confalonieri et al8 showing that septic shock was prevented by hydrocortisone in patients with CAP. Fourth, because occurrence of septic shock is associated with an increased risk of mortality,28 it was hypothesized that prevention of septic shock leading to organ dysfunction could also affect secondary outcome variables such as LOS in the ICU or mortality. If prolonged administration of hydrocortisone was able to prevent septic shock development, this beneficial effect of hydrocortisone could outweigh adverse effects such as hyperglycemia, which can be readily treated by administration of insulin. Vasopressor-dependent (volume-resistant) septic shock in patients with sepsis is still the key indication for suggesting hydrocortisone in the current international guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign.2 Hence, it seems plausible to take this as a primary end point if prevention of septic shock is tested. We assumed a rate of septic shock of 40% in patients with severe sepsis based on previous studies8,25-27 and data from the SepNet Clinical Trials Group. However, owing to different study populations, effect sizes, and septic shock criteria, only a rough estimation was possible (see limitations described later). According to recommendations of the German Sepsis Society to transfer patients with severe sepsis to an intermediate care unit or ICU, only patients treated in these units were enrolled in HYPRESS. This was different from a recent retrospective cohort study of patients with sepsis and similar lactate values but lower hospital mortality (7.9% mortality in the study by Liu et al29 vs 13.1% mortality in this study), who were treated predominantly in the general ward.29\n\nHowever, the current study did not show a protective effect on shock development, time to septic shock, mortality, or LOS in the ICU or hospital. The results are in contrast to a small study in 46 patients with severe CAP, in which hydrocortisone administration was associated with improved survival and significantly lower rates of septic shock. This study was prematurely stopped after an interim analysis owing to improvement of oxygenation and hospital mortality.8 The presented data did not support that hydrocortisone was more effective with regard to the primary or secondary end points in patients with pneumonia or in the subgroup of patients with CAP. However, recent larger RCTs of steroids in patients with CAP did not reveal reduction of mortality but did show some beneficial effects on other outcomes. In 304 non-ICU patients, a 4-day treatment with 5 mg of dexamethasone reduced median hospital LOS by 1 day.30 Another RCT enrolled 120 patients with severe CAP and a high inflammatory response who received methylprednisolone at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg twice daily or placebo for 5 days.10 Primary end points were parameters of early (<72 hours) or late (72-120 hours) treatment failure. Treatment failure rates were lower in patients who received steroids than in those who received placebo (13% vs 32%, respectively; P = .02), with late radiographic progression as the only significantly different parameter; notably, late septic shock was rare and less frequent in patients who received steroids than in those who received placebo (0 vs 4 patients, respectively). In the largest RCT to date, with 785 patients with CAP, patients received either 50 mg of prednisone or placebo for 7 days.9 The primary end point was time to clinical stability for at least 24 hours. Treatment with prednisone shortened time to clinical stability by 1 to 4 days irrespective of severity of CAP, and it shortened time to hospital discharge and duration of antibiotic therapy by 1 day. Thus, there is some evidence that moderate doses of steroids may be more effective in patients with CAP than other causes of sepsis.11\n\nAnother interesting finding in this study was that despite a higher risk of septic shock in patients with CIRCI, there was no detectable difference in septic shock development between treatment groups; however, sample size and event numbers were small. The results are in line with results of the CORTICUS trial, in which effects of hydrocortisone on septic shock resolution were independent from CIRCI. Moreover, in a CORTICUS subgroup analysis, etomidate administration was associated with a significantly higher risk for CIRCI and 28-day mortality. However, hydrocortisone treatment did not reduce mortality in patients with CIRCI who received etomidate.31 Whether combined biomarkers may be more suitable to detect eligible patients needs further investigation. A subgroup analysis of patients with CAP showed most effects in patients who had low basal cortisol levels combined with high proinflammatory cytokine profiles.32\n\nThe results from this study do not support an increased risk for secondary infections. Reasonable concerns were amplified by results of the CORTICUS trial, which showed higher numbers of secondary infections including new sepsis and septic shock in patients who received hydrocortisone.4 A Bayesian analysis, mainly based on CORT\n######################\nOutput:"

A total of 380 patients were randomized to receive hydrocortisone (n = 190) or placebo (n = 190). The median time from screening to enrollment was 12.5 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 6-21 hours) in the placebo group and 14 hours (IQR, 6.5-23 hours) in the hydrocortisone group (P = .49). The ITT population excluded 27 patients and included 353 patients (64.9% male; mean [SD] age, 65.0 [14.4] years) (Figure 1). The PP population consisted of 322 patients, and the safety analysis set included 375 patients. Six patients (2 in the placebo group, 4 in the hydrocortisone group) received a reduced dose (<80% of total dose according to protocol). Ten patients (5 in the placebo group, 5 in the hydrocortisone group) received an increased dose (quotient of applied dose and expected dose >1.2). These patients were excluded from the PP analysis. Follow-up was conducted until February 23, 2014.\n\nBaseline Characteristics and Treatment During Study\nTreatment arms were comparable regarding age, type of admission to the ICU, severity of disease or organ dysfunction, use of glucocorticoids or etomidate within 72 hours before randomization, initial treatment and vital signs within 6 hours after diagnosis of severe sepsis, administration of study medication, antibiotic therapy, and treatment characteristics during the study. Pneumonia was slightly more frequent in patients who received placebo (Table 1 and eTables 1, 2, and 3 in Supplement 1).\n\nPrimary End Point\nThere was no significant difference in the proportion of septic shock after 14 days between patients who received hydrocortisone or placebo in the ITT or PP population (Table 2). In the ITT population, septic shock occurred in 36 of 170 patients (21.2%) in the hydrocortisone group vs 39 of 170 patients (22.9%) in the placebo group (difference, −1.8%; 95% CI, −10.7% to 7.2%; P = .70). In the PP population, septic shock occurred in 29 of 155 patients (18.7%) in the hydrocortisone group vs 33 of 156 patients (21.2%) in the placebo group (difference, −2.4%; 95% CI, −11.5% to 6.6%; P = .59). In addition, no significant difference between the groups was observed regarding time to septic shock development (Figure 2), or in time to septic shock in those patients who developed septic shock (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Subgroup analysis of medical or surgical patients, patients with pneumonia, or study medication treatment for at least 48 hours did not reveal a benefit for shock prevention (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). To exclude a center effect, 11 sites that recruited at least 10 patients (n = 279) were analyzed; there was no heterogeneity for the primary end point (I2 = 0%; P = .74).\n\nSecondary End Points\nThere were no significant differences in 28-day, 90-day, 180-day, ICU, or hospital all-cause mortality; LOS in the ICU or hospital; ventilation- or renal replacement–free days; or median SOFA score until day 14 between patients treated with placebo or hydrocortisone (Table 2 and eFigure 3 in Supplement 1). At 28 days, mortality occurred in 15 of 171 patients (8.8%) in the hydrocortisone group and 14 of 170 patients (8.2%) in the placebo group (difference, 0.5%; 95% CI, −5.6% to 6.7%; P = .86). At 90 days, mortality occurred in 34 of 171 patients (19.9%) in the hydrocortisone group vs 28 of 168 patients (16.7%) in the placebo group (difference, 3.2%; 95% CI, −5.1% to 11.4%; P = .44). At 180 days, mortality occurred in 45 of 168 patients (26.8%) in the hydrocortisone group vs 37 of 167 patients (22.2%) in the placebo group (difference, 4.6%; 95% CI, −4.6% to 13.7%; P = .32). Analysis of the PP population revealed no significant differences for secondary end points between the treatment arms. A post hoc analysis of 54 patients with CAP did not reveal significant differences for the primary or secondary end points between patients treated with hydrocortisone (n = 24) or placebo (n = 30).\n\nAdverse Effects\nThere were more episodes of hyperglycemia (blood glucose level >150 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]) in the hydrocortisone group (169 of 186 patients [90.9%]) than in the placebo group (154 of 189 patients\n######################\nOutput:"

Among patients with septic shock, recombinant activated human protein C was administered in 102 patients in the dopamine group (18.8%) and 96 patients in the norepinephrine group (19.1%).\nFigure 1\n\nScreening and Enrollment.\nTable 1\n\nBaseline Characteristics of the Patients and Major Therapeutic Interventions at Baseline.\nData on hemodynamic variables and doses of vasoactive agents are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 in the Supplementary Appendix. The mean arterial pressure was similar in the two treatment groups at baseline, and it changed similarly over time, although it was slightly higher from 12 to 24 hours in the norepinephrine group. The doses of the study drug were similar in the two groups at all times. More patients in the dopamine group than in the norepinephrine group required open-label norepinephrine therapy at some point (26% vs. 20%, P<0.001), but the doses of open-label norepinephrine that were administered were similar in the two groups. The use of open-label epinephrine at any time was similar in the two groups (administered in 3.5% of patients in the dopamine group and in 2.3% of those in the norepinephrine group, P=0.10), as was the use of vasopressin (0.2% in both groups, P=0.67). Dobutamine was used more frequently in patients treated with norepinephrine, but 12 hours after randomization, the doses of dobutamine were significantly higher in patients treated with dopamine. The mean (±SD) time to the achievement of a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg was similar in the two groups (6.3±5.6 hours in the dopamine group and 6.0±4.9 hours in the norepinephrine group, P=0.35). There were no major between-group differences in the total amounts of fluid given, although patients in the dopamine group received more fluids on day 1 than did patients in the norepinephrine group. Urine output was significantly higher during the first 24 hours after randomization among patients in the dopamine group than among those in the norepinephrine group, but this difference eventually disappeared, so that the fluid balance was quite similar between the two groups.\nThe increase in heart rate was greater in patients treated with dopamine than in patients treated with norepinephrine, up to 36 hours after randomization; the changes in the cardiac index, central venous pressure, venous oxygen saturation, and lactate levels were similar in the two groups.\nOutcome\nThe boundary for stopping the trial owing to the lack of evidence of a difference between treatments at a P value of 0.05 was crossed (Figure 5 in the Supplementary Appendix). There were no significant differences between the groups in the rate of death at 28 days or in the rates of death in the ICU, in the hospital, at 6 months, or at 12 months (Table 2). Kaplan–Meier curves for estimated survival showed no significant differences in the outcome (Figure 2). Cox proportional-hazards analyses that included the APACHE II score, sex, and other relevant variables yielded similar results (Figure 6 in the Supplementary Appendix). There were more days without need for the trial drug and more days without need for open-label vasopressors in the norepinephrine group than in the dopamine group, but there were no significant differences between the groups in the number of days without need for ICU care and in the number of days without need for organ support (Table 3). There were no significant differences in the causes of death between the two groups, although death from refractory shock occurred more frequently in the group of patients treated with dopamine than in the group treated with norepinephrine (P=0.05).\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan–Meier Curves for 28-Day Survival in the Intention-to-Treat Population.\nTable 2\n\nMortality Rates.\nTable 3\n\nSecondary Outcomes and Adverse Events.\nAdverse Events\nOverall, 309 patients (18.4%) had an arrhythmia; the most common type of arrhythmia was atrial fibrillation, which occurred in 266 patients (86.1%). More patients had an arrhythmia, especially atrial fibrillation, in the dopamine group than in the norepinephrine group (Table 3). The study drug was discontinued in 65 patients owing to severe arrhythmias — 52 patients (6.1%) in the dopamine group and 13 patients (1.6%) in the norepinephrine group (P<0.001). These patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. There were no significant differences between the groups in the incidences of other adverse events.\nAdditional Analyses\nA predefined subgroup analysis was conducted according to the type of shock — septic shock, which occurred in 1044 patients (542 in the dopamine group and 502 in the norepinephrine group); cardiogenic shock, which occurred in 280 patients (135 in the dopamine group and 145 in the norepinephrine group); or hypovolemic shock, which occurred in 263 patients (138 in the dopamine group and 125 in the norepinephrine group). The overall effect of treatment did not differ significantly among these subgroups (P=0.87 for interaction), although the rate of death at 28 days was significantly higher among patients with cardiogenic shock who were treated with dopamine than among those with cardiogenic shock who were treated with norepinephrine (P=0.03\n######################\nOutput:"

In most of the patients who had been randomly assigned to EGDT, a central venous catheter for monitoring of ScvO2 was placed promptly (Fig. S6A in the Supplementary Appendix). The reasons for failure to place a central venous catheter, which occurred in 30 of the 439 patients in that group (6.8%), included technical difficulties (10 patients), refusal by the treating clinician (9) or patient (5), the need for emergency surgery (1), and death (1); no reason was provided in the case of 4 patients). The mean (±SD) ScvO2 after catheterization was 71±13%. Although placement of central venous catheters was not required for patients in the protocol-based standard-therapy group or the usual-care group, central venous catheters were placed in 56.5% of the patients (252 patients) and 57.9% (264 patients) in the two groups, respectively; however, placement occurred later than in the EGDT group (P<0.001) (Fig. S6B in the Supplementary Appendix) and involved serial monitoring of ScvO2 in only a small proportion of patients (4.0% [18 patients] in the protocol-based standard-therapy group and 3.5% [16 patients] in the usual-care groups, vs. 93.6% [411 patients] in the EGDT group; P<0.001).\nResuscitation\nDuring the first 6 hours, the volume of intravenous fluids administered differed significantly among the groups (2.8 liters in the protocol-based EGDT group, 3.3 liters in the protocol-based standard-therapy group, and 2.3 liters in the usual-care group (P<0.001) (Table S4 and Fig. S6C in the Supplementary Appendix). The volume of fluids administered decreased during the 6 hours in all the groups, but patients in the protocol-based standard-therapy group received the greatest volume initially and overall, patients in the usual-care group received the least volume of fluid, and patients in the protocol-based EGDT group received fluid at the most consistent rate (P<0.001 for differences in total volume and P=0.007 for differences over time). Crystalloids were the predominant fluid used in all the groups, administered in 96% of the patients overall. More patients in the two protocol-based groups than in the usual-care group received vasopressors (54.9% in the protocol-based EGDT group and 52.2% in the protocol-based standard-therapy group vs. 44.1% in the usual-care group, P=0.003) (Table S4 and Fig. S6D in the Supplementary Appendix). More patients in the protocol-based EGDT group than in the protocol-based standard-therapy group or the usual-care group received dobutamine and packed red-cell transfusions (dobutamine use, 8.0% vs. 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively; P<0.001; packed red-cell transfusions, 14.4% vs. 8.3% and 7.5%, respectively; P=0.001) (Table S4, and Fig. S6D in the Supplementary Appendix). The use of antibiotics, glucocorticoids, and activated protein C was similar across the three groups (with P values ranging from 0.16 to 0.90) (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nAncillary Care\nThe use of intravenous fluids, vasopressors, dobutamine, and blood transfusions between 6 and 72 hours did not differ significantly among the groups (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients in all three groups had mean values that were consistent with low-tidal-volume ventilation and moderate glycemic control (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). In general, the condition of the patients in all three groups improved over time, with few differences among the groups. By 6 hours, the target mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or higher had been achieved in more patients in each of the protocol-based groups than in the usual-care group (P=0.02), but the mean heart rate did not differ significantly among the groups (P=0.32) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients in the protocol-based EGDT group had a higher mean international normalized ratio at 6 hours (2.2, vs. 1.7 in the protocol-based standard-therapy group and 1.6 in the usual-care group; P=0.01), whereas patients in the usual-care group had slightly less acidosis at 6 hours and 24 hours (arterial pH, 7.31 in each protocol-based group vs. 7.34 in the usual-care group at 6 hours, and 7.34 in each protocol-based group vs. 7.36 in the usual-care group at 24 hours, P=0.02), but these differences did not persist.\nOutcomes\nBy day 60, a total of 92 patients in the protocol-based EGDT group (21.0%), 81 in the protocol-based standard-therapy group (18.2%), and 86 in the usual-care group (18.9%) had died in the hospital (Table 2). The 60-day in-hospital mortality for the combined protocol-based groups (19.5% [173 of 885 patients]) did not differ significantly from that in the usual-care group (relative risk, 1.04\n######################\nOutput:"

Adverse events were categorized as arrhythmias (i.e., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or atrial fibrillation), myocardial necrosis, skin necrosis, ischemia in limbs or distal extremities, or secondary infections.17\nMeasured Variables\nThe following data were recorded every 6 hours for 48 hours, every 8 hours on days 3, 4, and 5, and once a day on days 6, 7, 14, 21, and 28: vital signs, hemodynamic variables (including systolic and diastolic arterial pressures, heart rate, central venous pressure, and, when possible, pulmonary-artery pressures), cardiac output, arterial and mixed-venous (or central venous) blood gas levels, doses of vasoactive agents, and respiratory conditions. Biologic variables, data on daily fluid balance, microbiologic data, and antibiotic therapy were recorded daily for the first 7 days and then on days 14, 21, and 28.\nThe Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score18 was calculated at the time of admission to the ICU and at the time of enrollment in the study, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score19 was calculated daily for the first 7 days and then on days 14, 21, and 28.\nStatistical Analysis\nOn the basis of the results of the SOAP study,3 which showed a rate of death of 43% among patients receiving dopamine and a rate of 36% among patients receiving norepinephrine, we estimated that with 765 patients in each group, the study would have 80% power to show a 15% relative difference in the rate of death at 28 days, at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.\nSince the magnitude of the effect derived from observational studies can be misleading, we opted for a sequential trial design with two-sided alternatives20; the trial design called for analyses to be performed after inclusion of the first 50 and 100 patients, and then after inclusion of each additional 100 patients, and allowed for the discontinuation of the trial according to the following predefined boundaries: superiority of norepinephrine over dopamine, superiority of dopamine over norepinephrine, or no difference between the two. An independent statistician who is also a physician monitored the efficacy analyses and the adverse events; on October 6, 2007, after analysis of the outcome in the first 1600 patients showed that one of the three predefined boundaries had been crossed, the statistician advised that the trial be stopped.\nAll data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Differences in the primary outcome were analyzed with the use of an unadjusted chi-square test. Results are presented as absolute and relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Kaplan–Meier curves for estimated survival were compared with the use of a log-rank test. A Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used to evaluate the influence of potential confounding factors on the outcome (factors were selected if the P value in the univariate analysis was <0.20).\nA predefined subgroup analysis of the primary outcome was conducted according to the type of shock (septic, cardiogenic, or hypovolemic). A test for interaction was performed, and the results are presented in a forest plot.\nOther binary end points were analyzed with the use of chi-square tests, and continuous variables were compared by means of an unpaired Student's t-test or a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate, with the use of SPSS software, version 13.0 (SPSS). All reported P values are two-sided and have not been adjusted for multiple testing. The study statistician and investigators remained unaware of the patients' treatment assignments while they performed the final analyses.\nResults\nPatients\nA total of 1679 patients were enrolled — 858 in the dopamine group and 821 in the norepinephrine group (Figure 1). All patients were followed to day 28; data on the outcome during the stay in the hospital were available for 1656 patients (98.6%), data on the 6-month outcome for 1443 patients (85.9%), and data on the 12-month outcome for 1036 patients (61.7%). There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to most of the baseline characteristics (Table 1); there were small differences, which were of questionable clinical relevance, in the heart rate, partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), and ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2). The type of shock that was seen most frequently was septic shock (in 1044 patients [62.2%]), followed by cardiogenic shock (in 280 patients [16.7%]) and hypovolemic shock (in 263 patients [15.7%]). The sources of sepsis are detailed in Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix. Hydrocortisone was administered in 344 patients who received dopamine (40.1%) and in 326 patients who received norepinephrine (39.7%).

Hemodynamic management was started within 2 hours after catheter insertion and continued for seven days or until 12 hours after a patient was able to breathe without assistance.14 After day 3, a pulmonary-artery catheter could be replaced by a central venous catheter if hemodynamic stability (i.e., absence of the need for protocol-directed interventions on the basis of a measurement with a pulmonary-artery catheter for more than 24 hours) was achieved. We monitored compliance with protocol instructions twice each day: once during a morning reference period and again at a randomly selected time. A 100 percent audit of all instructions conducted after the first 82 patients were enrolled showed rates of protocol compliance similar to those obtained during the random checks (data not shown).\nStudy personnel underwent training in the conduct of the protocol (Figure 1) and the measurement of vascular pressure. Vascular pressures were measured in supine patients at end expiration (identified with an airway pressure signal) but were not adjusted for airway pressure.15\nFigure 1\n\nOverview of the Protocol for Conservative and Liberal Fluid Management in the Group Assigned to a Pulmonary-Artery Catheter (PAC) and the Group Assigned to a Central Venous Catheter (CVC).\nSubjects\nA National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute protocol-review committee, a data and safety monitoring board, and the institutional review board of each participating hospital approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained from participants or legally authorized surrogates. The data and safety monitoring board conducted interim analyses after the enrollment of 82 patients and then after the enrollment of approximately every 200 patients. Sequential stopping rules for safety and efficacy used the method of O'Brien and Fleming.16\nOrgan Failure\nFor 28 days, we monitored patients daily for cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic failure; coagulation abnormalities; and the need for assisted ventilation.14 The severity of lung injury was scored according to the method of Murray et al.17; the scores can range from 0 to 4, with a lower score indicating better lung function.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe study had a statistical power of 90 percent to detect a reduction by 10 percentage points (from 31 percent to 21 percent) in the primary end point, death before discharge home during the first 60 days after randomization, with the planned enrollment of 1000 patients. We assumed patients who went home without the use of assisted ventilation before day 60 were alive at 60 days. Data on patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation or in a hospital were censored on the last day of follow-up. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the mean (±SE) 60-day mortality rate at the time of the last death that occurred before 60 days. Differences in mortality between the groups were assessed by a z test. The primary analysis was conducted according to the intention to treat. We assessed differences in continuous variables with analysis of variance, differences in categorical variables with a Mantel–Haenszel test, and differences between continuous variables over time with repeated-measures analysis of variance. For continuous variables, means ±SE are reported. Two-sided P values of 0.05 or less were considered to indicate statistical significance. We used SAS software (version 8.2, SAS Institute) for the analysis.\nResults\nEnrollment and Exclusions\nWe screened patients at 20 North American centers between June 8, 2000, and October 3, 2005. The trial was halted on July 25, 2002, for a review by the Office of Human Research Protection and resumed unchanged on July 23, 2003, except for the introduction of a modified consent form.18–20 Figure 2 shows the most common reasons for exclusion for the 10,511 patients who were screened but not enrolled and the follow-up for the 503 patients who were randomly assigned to conservative fluid management and the 498 who were assigned to liberal fluid management (all reasons for exclusion are listed in Table 1 of the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nEnrollment and Outcomes.\nBaseline Characteristics\nThe two groups were similar with respect to demographic characteristics, type of intensive care unit (ICU), cause of lung injury, coexisting illnesses, severity of illness, organ function, fluid balance before the study began, vasopressor use, and presence of shock (Table 1).\nTable 1\n\nBaseline Characteristics.\nProtocol Conduct and Instructions\nThe mean time from admission to the ICU to the first protocol instruction was 41.3±1.6 hours in the liberal-strategy group and 43.8±2.5 hours in the conservative-strategy group (P=0.42). The rate of compliance with instructions was similar in the two groups (91 percent in the liberal-strategy group and 88 percent in the conservative-strategy group, P=0.06), even though patients in the former group received more protocol instructions per day (5.1 vs. 4.1, P<0.001). Patients in the conservative-strategy group received furosemide more frequently than did patients in the liberal-strategy group (41 percent vs. 10 percent of instructions, P<0.001), whereas patients in the latter group more often received a fluid bolus (15 percent vs. 6 percent of instructions, P<0.001). More furosemide was given to the conservative-strategy group (Table 2). Dobutamine use was similar and uncommon in both groups (4 percent in the liberal-strategy group and 6 percent in the conservative-strategy group).

The efficacy of hydrocortisone in patients with severe sepsis without shock remains controversial.\n\nObjective  To determine whether hydrocortisone therapy in patients with severe sepsis prevents the development of septic shock.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  Double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted from January 13, 2009, to August 27, 2013, with a follow-up of 180 days until February 23, 2014. The trial was performed in 34 intermediate or intensive care units of university and community hospitals in Germany, and it included 380 adult patients with severe sepsis who were not in septic shock.\n\nInterventions  Patients were randomly allocated 1:1 either to receive a continuous infusion of 200 mg of hydrocortisone for 5 days followed by dose tapering until day 11 (n = 190) or to receive placebo (n = 190).\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was development of septic shock within 14 days. Secondary outcomes were time until septic shock, mortality in the intensive care unit or hospital, survival up to 180 days, and assessment of secondary infections, weaning failure, muscle weakness, and hyperglycemia (blood glucose level >150 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]).\n\nResults  The intention-to-treat population consisted of 353 patients (64.9% male; mean [SD] age, 65.0 [14.4] years). Septic shock occurred in 36 of 170 patients (21.2%) in the hydrocortisone group and 39 of 170 patients (22.9%) in the placebo group (difference, −1.8%; 95% CI, −10.7% to 7.2%; P = .70). No significant differences were observed between the hydrocortisone and placebo groups for time until septic shock; mortality in the intensive care unit or in the hospital; or mortality at 28 days (15 of 171 patients [8.8%] vs 14 of 170 patients [8.2%], respectively; difference, 0.5%; 95% CI, −5.6% to 6.7%; P = .86), 90 days (34 of 171 patients [19.9%] vs 28 of 168 patients [16.7%]; difference, 3.2%; 95% CI, −5.1% to 11.4%; P = .44), and 180 days (45 of 168 patients [26.8%] vs 37 of 167 patients [22.2%], respectively; difference, 4.6%; 95% CI, −4.6% to 13.7%; P = .32). In the hydrocortisone vs placebo groups, 21.5% vs 16.9% had secondary infections, 8.6% vs 8.5% had weaning failure, 30.7% vs 23.8% had muscle weakness, and 90.9% vs 81.5% had hyperglycemia.\n\nConclusions and Relevance  Among adults with severe sepsis not in septic shock, use of hydrocortisone compared with placebo did not reduce the risk of septic shock within 14 days. These findings do not support the use of hydrocortisone in these patients.\n\nTrial Registration  clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00670254\n\nIntroduction\nDespite decades of study and debate, the role of adjunctive “low-dose” hydrocortisone treatment (200-300 mg/d) in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock remains controversial.1 The current recommendation for hydrocortisone use is mainly based on 2 randomized clinical trials (RCTs).2 In the study by Annane et al,3 hydrocortisone improved survival and reversal of septic shock in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency. In the CORTICUS study,4 septic shock was reversed more quickly but mortality was not significantly reduced. The higher risk of mortality and septic shock severity in the study by Annane and colleagues resulted in more restrictive recommendations for hydrocortisone use only in patients with inadequate response to fluid and vasopressor resuscitation.2 However, septic shock reversal in the CORTICUS study was reported to be significantly accelerated by the administration of hydrocortisone irrespective of the adrenal response to corticotropin. An international consensus statement recommended replacing the terms relative or absolute adrenal insufficiency, which reflect only adrenal cortisol release, by the critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) concept.5\n\nAlthough meta-analyses report controversial results on mortality reduction by administration of corticosteroids,6,7 there is consistency regarding shock reversal irrespective of disease severity or the presence of CIRCI.5-7 In a smaller RCT in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hydrocortisone significantly improved survival and prevented progression to shock.8 Furthermore, 2 recent RCTs9,10 and a meta-analysis11 revealed positive effects of steroids in patients with CAP. Assuming that severe sepsis and septic shock reflect a disease continuum, it was hypothesized that early hydrocortisone administration might prevent shock development owing to the attenuation of an exaggerated inflammatory response.\n######################\nOutput:"

We therefore conducted a trial to determine whether ventilation with lower tidal volumes would improve the clinical outcomes in these patients.\nMethods\nPatients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized trial. The trial compared traditional ventilation treatment, which involved an initial tidal volume of 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and an airway pressure measured after a 0.5-second pause at the end of inspiration (plateau pressure) of 50 cm of water or less, with ventilation with a lower tidal volume, which involved an initial tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of 30 cm of water or less. The first primary outcome was death before a patient was discharged home and was breathing without assistance. The second primary outcome was the number of days without ventilator use from day 1 to day 28.\nResults\nThe trial was stopped after the enrollment of 861 patients because mortality was lower in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes (31.0 percent vs. 39.8 percent, P=0.007), and the number of days without ventilator use during the first 28 days after randomization was greater in this group (mean [±SD], 12±11 vs. 10±11; P=0.007). The mean tidal volumes on days 1 to 3 were 6.2±0.8 and 11.8±0.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight (P<0.001), respectively, and the mean plateau pressures were 25±6 and 33±8 cm of water (P<0.001), respectively.\nConclusions\nIn patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation with a lower tidal volume than is traditionally used results in decreased mortality and increases the number of days without ventilator use.\nThe mortality rate from acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome1 is approximately 40 to 50 percent.2–4 Although substantial progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms of acute lung injury,5 there has been little progress in developing effective treatments.\nTraditional approaches to mechanical ventilation use tidal volumes of 10 to 15 ml per kilogram of body weight.6 These volumes are larger than those in normal subjects at rest (range, 7 to 8 ml per kilogram), but they are frequently necessary to achieve normal values for the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and pH. Since atelectasis and edema reduce aerated lung volumes in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome,7,8 inspiratory airway pressures are often high, suggesting the presence of excessive distention, or “stretch,” of the aerated lung. In animals, ventilation with the use of large tidal volumes caused the disruption of pulmonary epithelium and endothelium, lung inflammation, atelectasis, hypoxemia, and the release of inflammatory mediators.9–14 The release of inflammatory mediators could increase lung inflammation and cause injury to other organs.10,15 Thus, the traditional approach to mechanical ventilation may exacerbate or perpetuate lung injury in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome and increase the risk of nonpulmonary organ or system failure.\nThe use of lower tidal volumes during ventilation in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome may reduce injurious lung stretch and the release of inflammatory mediators.16–18 However, this approach may cause respiratory acidosis16,17 and decrease arterial oxygenation19,20 and may therefore require changes in the priority of some objectives in the care of these patients. With the traditional approach, the attainment of normal partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and pH is given a higher priority than is protection of the lung from excessive stretch. With an approach that involves lower tidal volumes, the reverse is true. Uncontrolled studies suggested that the use of a lower tidal volume would reduce mortality in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome,17 but the results of four randomized trials of lung-protecting ventilation strategies have been conflicting.21–24 The present trial was conducted to determine whether the use of a lower tidal volume with mechanical ventilation would improve important clinical outcomes in such patients.\nMethods\nPatients\nPatients were recruited from March 1996 through March 1999 at the 10 university centers of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (the centers are listed in the Appendix). The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each hospital, and informed consent was obtained from the patients or surrogates at all but one hospital, where this requirement was waived. A complete description of the methods is available on the World Wide Web (at www.ardsnet.org) or from the National Auxiliary Publications Service (NAPS).\nPatients who were intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation were eligible for the study if they had an acute decrease in the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen to 300 or less (indicating the onset of hypoxemia; values were adjusted for altitude in Denver and Salt Lake City), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on a chest radiograph consistent with the presence of edema, and no clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension or (if measured) a pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure of 18 mm Hg or less.1 Patients were excluded if 36 hours had elapsed since they met the first three criteria; they were younger than 18 years of age; they had participated in other trials within 30 days before the first three criteria were met; they were pregnant; they\n######################\nOutput:"

(Appendix 1).26 Patients were eligible for the trial if they had a known or suspected infection on the basis of clinical data at the time of screening and if they met the following criteria within a 24-hour period: three or more signs of systemic inflammation and the sepsis-induced dysfunction of at least one organ or system that lasted no longer than 24 hours. Patients had to begin treatment within 24 hours after they met the inclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria are summarized in Appendix 2.\nTreatment Assignments\nPatients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to receive drotrecogin alfa activated or placebo (0.9 percent saline with or without 0.1 percent human serum albumin) at each center. Block randomization stratified according to site was used, and all assignments were made through a central randomization center. Drotrecogin alfa activated, at a dose of 24 μg per kilogram of body weight per hour, or placebo was administered intravenously at a constant rate from foil-wrapped bags for a total duration of 96 hours. The patients, investigators, and the sponsor were unaware of the patients' treatment assignments. Drotrecogin alfa activated was produced from an established mammalian cell line into which the complementary DNA for human protein C had been inserted.27\nThe infusion was interrupted 1 hour before any percutaneous procedure or major surgery and was resumed 1 hour and 12 hours later, respectively, in the absence of bleeding complications. The study protocol did not call for a standardized approach to critical care (e.g., the use of antibiotics, fluids, vasopressors, or ventilatory support).\nEvaluation of Patients\nPatients were followed for 28 days after the start of the infusion or until death. Base-line characteristics including demographic information and information on preexisting conditions, organ function, markers of disease severity, infection, and hematologic and other laboratory tests were assessed within 24 hours before the infusion was begun. Blood samples obtained at base line, on days 1 through 7, and on days 14 and 28 were assayed for D-dimer levels (Liatest D-D1 latex agglutination test kit, Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres, France) and for interleukin-6 levels (Quantikine HS enzyme immunoassay kit, R & D Systems, Minneapolis). All measurements were performed by a central laboratory (Covance Central Lab Services, Indianapolis). Blood samples for the measurement of neutralizing antibodies against activated protein C were collected on days 14 and 28 or at the time of discharge from the hospital if it occurred before one or both of these dates. Microbiologic-culture results were assessed each day beginning 48 hours after the initiation of the infusion and continuing through day 28. Patients were defined as having a deficiency of protein C if their plasma protein C activity level was below the lower limit of normal (81 percent) within 24 hours before the initiation of the infusion and defined as having septic shock if they met the criteria for cardiovascular dysfunction at any time within 6 hours before the start of the infusion.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe primary efficacy end point was death from any cause and was assessed 28 days after the initiation of the infusion. Our prospectively defined primary analysis included all patients who received the infusion for any length of time, with patients analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were assigned at randomization. The trial was designed to enroll 2280 patients; two planned interim analyses by an independent data and safety monitoring board occurred after 760 and 1520 patients had been enrolled. Statistical guidelines to suspend enrollment if drotrecogin alfa activated was found to be significantly more efficacious than placebo were determined a priori and used the O'Brien–Fleming spending function according to the method of Lan and DeMets.28\nData were analyzed according to a prospectively defined plan. The primary analysis was based on a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test in which the groups were stratified on the basis of three baseline covariates: severity of disease, as reflected by the score on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II)29 (3 to 19, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, or 30 to 53, with higher scores indicating more severe disease); age (younger than 60 years or 60 years or older); and plasma protein C activity level (40 percent or less, 41 to 60 percent, 61 to 80 percent, 81 percent or more, or unknown). The corresponding relative risk and 95 percent confidence interval were calculated with use of the logit-adjusted method. The time from the start of the infusion to death was compared in the two groups in a similar manner with use of a stratified log-rank test. Results of both stratified and nonstratified analyses are reported. We evaluated the consistency of the effects of treatment on the risk of death in the subgroups by determining whether the relative risk and 95 percent confidence interval for each subgroup included the observed relative risk for the entire population.\nChanges from base-line levels of plasma D-dimer and serum interleukin-6 were analyzed in patients who had subsequent measurements with the use of analysis of variance of ranked data. For patients with missing data, we used the last-observation-carried-forward method of imputation. The proportion of patients who had serious adverse events and new infections was compared in the two groups with the use of Pearson's chi-square tests. All reported P values are two-sided.\nResults\nAt\n######################\nOutput:"

Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables, including the primary outcome. Absolute and relative risk differences with 95% confidence intervals for all-cause mortality at 90 days are reported. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed with the use of multivariable logistic regression adjusted for predefined baseline covariates: country, age, score on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), systolic blood pressure (<90 mm Hg or ≥90 mm Hg), and presence or absence of invasive mechanical ventilation. We used the Kaplan–Meier method to calculate survival time from randomization to 90 days and the log-rank test to perform between-group comparisons. We used Cox proportional-hazards models adjusted for the previously specified baseline covariates to calculate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Values for length of hospital stay and duration of organ support were log-transformed and analyzed with the use of linear regression and are reported as ratios with 95% confidence intervals.\nWe conducted subgroup analyses for the primary outcome for predefined variables: country, age (<65 years or ≥65 years), APACHE II score (<25 or ≥25), presence or absence of invasive mechanical ventilation, presence or absence or refractory hypotension, lactate level (<4.0 mmol per liter or ≥4.0 mmol per liter), and intravenous fluid administration (<20 ml per kilogram of body weight or ≥20 ml per kilogram). Subgroup analyses were performed with the use of logistic regression, with heterogeneity determined on the basis of interaction between treatment and subgroup. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for death at 90 days are presented in a forest plot.\nAll analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute). A two-sided P value of 0.05 or less was considered to indicate statistical significance, except for the primary outcome, for which a P value of 0.0491 or less was used.\nResults\nStudy Patients\nWe enrolled 1600 patients, with 796 assigned to the EGDT group and 804 to the usual-care group (Figure 1). Delayed consent was refused for 9 patients (3 in the EGDT group and 6 in the usual-care group), leaving an intention-to-treat population of 793 patients and 798 patients, respectively. By day 90, 1 patient in the usual-care group had revoked consent, and 2 patients (1 in each group) were lost to follow-up, leaving a final cohort of 1588 patients for whom the primary outcome was available: 792 (99.5%) in the EGDT group and 796 (99.0%) in the usual-care group.\nFigure 1\n\nEnrollment and Outcomes.\nDemographic and clinical characteristics at baseline were similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).31,32 The criterion for refractory hypotension was met by 555 patients (70.0%) in the EGDT group and 557 (69.8%) in the usual-case group. The criterion for an elevated lactate level was met by 365 patients (46.0%) in the EGDT group and 371 (46.5%) in the usual-care group (Table 1). There was no significant difference in the mean intravenous fluid volume that had been infused at baseline, with 2515±1244 ml (34.6±19.4 ml per kilogram) in the EGDT group and 2591±1331 ml (34.7±20.1 ml per kilogram) in the usual-care group. The median time from presentation to the emergency department until randomization was 2.8 hours (interquartile range, 2.1 to 3.9) in the EDGT group and 2.7 hours (interquartile range, 2.0 to 3.9) in the usual-care group.\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\nMicrobiologic Data\nThe median time between presentation to the emergency department and administration of the first dose of intravenous antimicrobial therapy was similar in the two groups: 70 minutes (interquartile range, 38 to 114) in the EGDT group and 67 minutes (interquartile range, 39 to 110) in the usual-care group. The lungs and urinary tract were the most common locations of infection, and blood cultures were positive in 38% of patients in each study group. The numbers of patients receiving treatment to control the source of infection up to 72 hours after randomization were 78 (9.8%) in the EGDT group and 97 (12.2%) in the usual-care group (P=0.14). Detailed microbiologic data are presented in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nInterventions and Therapies\nPatients who were admitted directly from the emergency department to the ICU numbered 690 (87.0%) in the EGDT group and 614 (76.9%) in the usual-case group (P<0.001). A central venous catheter for continuous monitoring of the ScvO2 was inserted during the first 6 hours after randomization in 714 patients (90.0%) in the EGDT group. The median time to insertion was 1.1 hours (interquartile range, 0.7 to 1.6), and the mean ScvO2 was 72.7±10.5%.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive mechanical ventilation involving either traditional tidal volumes or lower tidal volumes.\nVentilator Procedures\nThe volume-assist–control mode was used for the ventilator until the patient was weaned from the device or for 28 days after randomization on day 0. Because normal lung volumes are predicted on the basis of sex and height,26,27 a predicted body weight was calculated for each patient from these data.28 The predicted body weight of male patients was calculated as equal to 50 + 0.91(centimeters of height – 152.4); that of female patients was calculated as equal to 45.5 + 0.91(centimeters of height – 152.4). In the group treated with traditional tidal volumes, the initial tidal volume was 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. This was subsequently reduced stepwise by 1 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight if necessary to maintain the airway pressure measured after a 0.5-second pause at the end of inspiration (plateau pressure) at a level of 50 cm of water or less. The minimal tidal volume was 4 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. If the plateau pressure dropped below 45 cm of water, the tidal volume was increased in steps of 1 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight until the plateau pressure was at least 45 cm of water or the tidal volume was 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight.\nIn the group treated with lower tidal volumes, the tidal volume was reduced to 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight within four hours after randomization and was subsequently reduced stepwise by 1 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight if necessary to maintain plateau pressure at a level of no more than 30 cm of water. The minimal tidal volume was 4 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. If plateau pressure dropped below 25 cm of water, tidal volume was increased in steps of 1 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight until the plateau pressure was at least 25 cm of water or the tidal volume was 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. For patients with severe dyspnea, the tidal volume could be increased to 7 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight if the plateau pressure remained 30 cm of water or less.\nPlateau pressures were measured with a half-second inspiratory pause at four-hour intervals and after changes in the tidal volume or positive end-expiratory pressure. Plateau pressures of more than 50 cm of water in the patients in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes and of more than 30 cm of water in patients in the group treated with lower tidal volumes were allowed if the tidal volume was 4 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight or if arterial pH was less than 7.15.\nAll other objectives and ventilation procedures, including weaning, were identical in the two study groups (Table 1). If a patient became able to breathe without assistance but subsequently required additional mechanical ventilation within a period of 28 days, the same tidal-volume protocol was resumed.\nTable 1\n\nSummary of Ventilator Procedures.\nOrgan or System Failure\nPatients were monitored daily for 28 days for signs of the failure of nonpulmonary organs and systems.29 Circulatory failure was defined as a systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less or the need for treatment with any vasopressor; coagulation failure as a platelet count of 80,000 per cubic millimeter or less; hepatic failure as a serum bilirubin concentration of at least 2 mg per deciliter (34 μmol per liter); and renal failure as a serum creatinine concentration of at least 2 mg per deciliter (177 μmol per liter). We calculated the number of days without organ or system failure by subtracting the number of days with organ failure from the lesser of 28 days or the number of days to death. Organs and systems were considered failure-free after patients were discharged from the hospital.\nPlasma Interleukin-6 Concentrations\nBlood samples were obtained from 204 of the first 234 patients on day 0 and on day 3 for measurement of plasma interleukin-6 by immunoassay (R & D Systems, Minneapolis).30 Blood samples were stored in sterile EDTA-treated glass tubes.\nData Collection\nData on demographic, physiologic, and radiographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, and medications were recorded within four hours before the ventilator settings were changed on day 0.

The 60-day in-hospital mortality for the combined protocol-based groups (19.5% [173 of 885 patients]) did not differ significantly from that in the usual-care group (relative risk, 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.31; P=0.83), nor did mortality differ significantly when the groups were compared separately (with P values ranging from 0.31 to 0.89) (Table 2 and Figure 2A). There were also no significant differences in 90-day mortality or in the time to death up to 90 days and 1 year (P=0.66 for 90-day mortality and P=0.70 and P=0.92 for cumulative mortality at 90 days and 1 year, respectively) (Table 2 and Figure 2B). Results were essentially unchanged when adjusted for potential site heterogeneity (odds of 60-day in-hospital death with protocol-based care vs. usual care, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.38; P=0.54).\nFigure 2\n\nCumulative Mortality.\nTable 2\n\nOutcomes.\nThe incidence of acute renal failure, as indicated by a new need for renal-replacement therapy, was higher in the protocol-based standard-therapy group than in the other two groups (6.0% in the protocol-based standard-therapy group vs. 3.1% in the protocol-based EGDT group and 2.8% in the usual-care group, P=0.04), although the duration of therapy did not differ significantly across the groups (Table 2). The rate of admission to the intensive care unit was higher in the protocol-based EGDT group than in the other two groups, although among patients who were admitted, there were no significant between-group differences in the length of stay in the intensive care unit (Table 2). There were no significant differences in the incidence and duration of cardiovascular failure or respiratory failure, nor were there significant differences in the length of stay in the hospital or the discharge disposition (Table 2).\nReports of potentially serious adverse events (excluding death) were rare and did not differ significantly across groups (Table 2, and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). There were no significant interactions between the assigned treatment and any prespecified subgroup with respect to the primary outcome of 60-day in-hospital mortality or with respect to the secondary mortality outcomes (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). Similarly, in a post hoc analysis, there was no evidence of a treatment effect within ranges of values for the APACHE II score, serum lactate level, or time from meeting the criteria for shock to randomization (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nDiscussion\nIn our study, adherence to the two experimental protocols was high, and, as expected, protocol-based care, as compared with usual care, resulted in increased use of central venous catheterization, intravenous fluids, vasoactive agents, and blood transfusions. The two protocol-based resuscitation approaches led to a small but transient improvement in blood pressure by the end of the resuscitation period but a higher requirement for intensive care and renal-replacement therapy. There were no significant differences in mortality, either overall or in a number of prespecified and post hoc subgroups.\nOur results differ from those of Rivers et al.4; however, our study was not a direct replication of that study, and there are probably several factors that contribute to the differences. Although the two trials used similar inclusion criteria, the enrolled populations differed. The study cohorts were similar with respect to many demographic and clinical characteristics, including the severity of illness (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix), but the cohort in the study by Rivers et al. was slightly older, had higher rates of preexisting heart and liver disease, and had a higher initial serum lactate level. Although we modified the minimum fluid bolus required to establish the presence of refractory hypotension, the mean volume of the bolus that was administered fell within the range used in the study by Rivers et al. (20 to 30 ml per kilogram). The mean initial ScvO2 reported by Rivers et al. was 49%, which was lower than that in the ProCESS trial. However, early central venous catheterization was considered to be part of usual care in that trial, allowing ScvO2 readings to be made before administration of the initial fluid bolus, the response to which was required to establish refractory hypotension. In contrast, for patients randomly assigned to the protocol-based EGDT group in our study, we measured ScvO2 only after the initial fluid bolus had been administered, making a direct comparison problematic. Nonetheless, the cohort in the study by Rivers et al. may have had, on average, more severe or persistent shock than the patients in our cohort. However, we were unable to show a benefit even when we restricted the analyses to the sickest third of our patients — those with the highest serum lactate levels and those with the highest APACHE II scores.\nBoth trials used the same EGDT protocol delivered by a trained, dedicated team at each site. Rivers et al. reported nearly perfect adherence but did not provide details regarding the assessment method. Although adherence to the protocol was high in our study, we cannot exclude the possibility that the outcome would have been better if adherence had been perfect. We believe that the rate of adherence in our study parallels the likely performance in any widespread effort targeting the care of patients with\n######################\nOutput:"

At 6 hours, values for central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, and hemoglobin were similar in the two groups among patients in whom they were measured, which happened with greater frequency in the EGDT group (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nAfter the Intervention Period\nBetween 6 and 72 hours, the numbers of patients in the two groups receiving intravenous fluids were similar, but patients in the usual-care group received larger volumes. More patients in the EGDT group received intravenous colloids, but overall volumes were similar in the two groups. The number of patients receiving intravenous crystalloids was similar in the two groups, but volumes were larger in the usual-care group. The number of patients receiving red-cell transfusions was higher in the EGDT group, but volumes were larger in the usual-care group. The use of vasopressors and dobutamine remained higher in the EGDT group. Although the numbers of patients receiving platelets and fresh-frozen plasma were similar in the two groups, the volume of platelets was larger in the EGDT group, whereas the volume of fresh-frozen plasma was higher in the usual-care group (Table 2, and Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). At 72 hours, physiological, biochemical, and SOFA values were similar in the two groups (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nPrimary Outcome\nMortality at 90 days was not significantly different in the two groups, with deaths reported in 184 of 623 patients (29.5%) in the EGDT group versus 181 of 620 patients (29.2%) in the usual-care group, with an unadjusted relative risk in the EGDT group of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.20; P=0.90), for an absolute risk reduction of −0.3 percentage points (95% CI, −5.4 to 4.7). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, the odds ratio was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.74 to 1.24; P=0.73) (Table 3). Sensitivity analyses for patients with a missing primary outcome (2 in the EGDT group and 6 in the usual-care group) showed relative risks ranging from 0.99 to 1.03. There was no evidence of a learning-curve effect (P=0.56). In the adherence-adjusted analysis, the relative risk was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.32; P=0.90) (Table S9 and Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 3\n\nStudy Outcomes.\nSecondary Outcomes\nThe mean SOFA score at 6 hours, the proportion of patients receiving advanced cardiovascular support, and the median length of stay in the ICU were significantly greater in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group. No other secondary outcomes were significantly different (Table 3, and Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). There was no significant difference in the duration of survival between the two groups (P=0.63 by the log-rank test; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.94, 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.11; P=0.46) (Figure 2). Mean EQ-5D scores and QALYs were similar in the two groups. The average cost was higher in the EGDT group (£12,414 [U.S. $17,647]) than in the usual-care group (£11,424 [U.S. $16,239]), but the difference was not significant (P=0.26) (Table 3, and Tables S11 through S16 and Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The incremental net benefit for EGDT as compared with usual care was negative and similar across prespecified subgroups and alternative scenarios that were considered in sensitivity analyses (Tables S17 and S18 and Fig. S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). The probability that EGDT was cost-effective was below 20% (Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan–Meier Survival Estimates.\nSubgroup Analyses\nThere was no significant difference regarding the effect of EGDT according to prespecified subgroups as defined by the degree of protocolized care used in the usual-care group, age, MEDS score, SOFA score, or time from presentation at the emergency department to randomization (P=0.39 to 0.72 for interaction) (Table S9 and Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nSerious Adverse Events\nAt least one serious adverse event was reported in 30 patients (4.8%) in the EGDT group and 26 patients (4.2%) in the usual-care group (P=0.58) (Table 3, and Table S19 in the Supplementary Appendix). Four serious adverse events were reported as being related to EGDT (two cases of pulmonary edema and one of arrhythmia, which were deemed to be probably related, and one case of myocardial ischemia, which was deemed to be definitely related), as compared with four events (in three patients) related to usual care (two cases of pneumothorax and one case of pulmonary edema, which were deemed to be probably related, and one case of ventricular fibrillation, which was deemed to be definitely related).\nDiscussion\nIn our study involving adults with early signs of septic shock who presented to emergency departments in England, there was no significant difference in mortality at 90 days among those receiving\n######################\nOutput:"

        "text": "During the 6-hour intervention period, administration of platelets and fresh-frozen plasma was similar in the two groups, although the volume of each was higher in the EGDT group (Table 2). At 6 hours, values for central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, and hemoglobin were similar in the two groups among patients in whom they were measured, which happened with greater frequency in the EGDT group (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nAfter the Intervention Period\nBetween 6 and 72 hours, the numbers of patients in the two groups receiving intravenous fluids were similar, but patients in the usual-care group received larger volumes. More patients in the EGDT group received intravenous colloids, but overall volumes were similar in the two groups. The number of patients receiving intravenous crystalloids was similar in the two groups, but volumes were larger in the usual-care group. The number of patients receiving red-cell transfusions was higher in the EGDT group, but volumes were larger in the usual-care group. The use of vasopressors and dobutamine remained higher in the EGDT group. Although the numbers of patients receiving platelets and fresh-frozen plasma were similar in the two groups, the volume of platelets was larger in the EGDT group, whereas the volume of fresh-frozen plasma was higher in the usual-care group (Table 2, and Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). At 72 hours, physiological, biochemical, and SOFA values were similar in the two groups (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nPrimary Outcome\nMortality at 90 days was not significantly different in the two groups, with deaths reported in 184 of 623 patients (29.5%) in the EGDT group versus 181 of 620 patients (29.2%) in the usual-care group, with an unadjusted relative risk in the EGDT group of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.20; P=0.90), for an absolute risk reduction of −0.3 percentage points (95% CI, −5.4 to 4.7). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, the odds ratio was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.74 to 1.24; P=0.73) (Table 3). Sensitivity analyses for patients with a missing primary outcome (2 in the EGDT group and 6 in the usual-care group) showed relative risks ranging from 0.99 to 1.03. There was no evidence of a learning-curve effect (P=0.56). In the adherence-adjusted analysis, the relative risk was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.32; P=0.90) (Table S9 and Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 3\n\nStudy Outcomes.\nSecondary Outcomes\nThe mean SOFA score at 6 hours, the proportion of patients receiving advanced cardiovascular support, and the median length of stay in the ICU were significantly greater in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group. No other secondary outcomes were significantly different (Table 3, and Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). There was no significant difference in the duration of survival between the two groups (P=0.63 by the log-rank test; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.94, 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.11; P=0.46) (Figure 2). Mean EQ-5D scores and QALYs were similar in the two groups. The average cost was higher in the EGDT group (£12,414 [U.S. $17,647]) than in the usual-care group (£11,424 [U.S. $16,239]), but the difference was not significant (P=0.26) (Table 3, and Tables S11 through S16 and Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The incremental net benefit for EGDT as compared with usual care was negative and similar across prespecified subgroups and alternative scenarios that were considered in sensitivity analyses (Tables S17 and S18 and Fig. S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). The probability that EGDT was cost-effective was below 20% (Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan–Meier Survival Estimates.\nSubgroup Analyses\nThere was no significant difference regarding the effect of EGDT according to prespecified subgroups as defined by the degree of protocolized care used in the usual-care group, age, MEDS score, SOFA score, or time from presentation at the emergency department to randomization (P=0.39 to 0.72 for interaction) (Table S9 and Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nSerious Adverse Events\nAt least one serious adverse event was reported in 30 patients (4.8%) in the EGDT group and 26 patients (4.2%) in the usual-care group (P=0.58) (Table 3, and Table S19 in the Supplementary Appendix). Four serious adverse events were reported as being related to EGDT (two cases of pulmonary edema and one of arrhythmia, which were deemed to be probably related, and one case of myocardial ischemia, which was deemed to be definitely related), as compared with four events (in three patients) related to usual care (two cases of pneumothorax and one case of pulmonary edema, which were deemed to be probably related, and one case of ventricular fibrillation, which was deemed to be definitely related).\nDiscussion\nIn our study involving adults with early signs of septic shock who presented to emergency departments in England, there was no significant difference in mortality at 90 days among those receiving"

The North West London Research Ethics Committee approved the study protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded the study and convened a trial steering committee and independent data monitoring and ethics committee. The Clinical Trials Unit at the United Kingdom Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) managed the study (for details, see the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). Edwards Lifesciences loaned monitors and provided training and technical support but had no other role in the study.\nSites and Patients\nThe study was conducted in English NHS hospitals that did not routinely use EGDT that included continuous ScvO2 monitoring. Adults (≥18 years of age) were eligible if within 6 hours after presentation to the emergency department they had a known or presumed infection, two or more criteria of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome,16 and either refractory hypotension (systolic blood pressure, <90 mm Hg; or mean arterial pressure, <65 mm Hg, despite resuscitation with at least 1 liter of intravenous fluids within 60 minutes) or hyperlactatemia (blood lactate level, ≥4 mmol per liter) and did not meet any exclusion criteria (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix).\nRandomization had to be completed within 2 hours after the patient met the inclusion criteria. All patients provided written informed consent, or consent was granted through an agreement with a personal or professional consultee or independent clinician.17 Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio by means of 24-hour telephone randomization to receive either EGDT or usual care. Study-group assignment was performed by means of randomized permuted blocks, with variable block lengths of 4, 6, and 8, and stratified according to site. In all study patients, antimicrobial drugs were initiated before randomization.\nStudy Interventions\nAfter randomization, the usual-care group continued to receive monitoring, investigations, and treatment as determined by the treating clinicians, whereas the EGDT group started the resuscitation protocol (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). For the latter, during the first hour, which was defined as the next whole hour (e.g., if randomization was performed at 9:24, then by 11 o'clock), a central venous catheter capable of continuous ScvO2 monitoring was placed. The resuscitation protocol was followed for 6 hours (intervention period) with personnel involved and treatment location decided according to the site. At least one trained staff member was available throughout the intervention period. Key staff members were trained before the initiation of recruitment at each site. All other treatment, during the intervention period and after, was at the discretion of the treating clinicians. Blinding to study-group assignment was not possible. During the intervention period, data were collected prospectively for the EGDT group and retrospectively for the usual-care group to avoid the influence of data collection on treatment delivery.\nOutcome Measures\nThe primary clinical outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were the score on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)18 at 6 hours and 72 hours; receipt of advanced cardiovascular, advanced respiratory, or renal support and the number of days in the first 28 days after randomization that were free from such support19; length of stay in the emergency department, intensive care unit (ICU), and hospital; duration of survival; all-cause mortality at 28 days, at hospital discharge, and at 1 year; and health-related quality of life (as measured on the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions [EQ-5D] five-level questionnaire), resource use, and costs at 90 days and 1 year. Adverse events were monitored up to 30 days. All definitions are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\nStatistical Analysis\nUsing the ICNARC Case Mix Program Database,20 we estimated that 90-day mortality would be 40% in the usual-care group. On the basis of this estimation, we calculated that an enrollment of 1260 patients would have a power of 80% to detect a relative reduction of 20% in risk (absolute risk reduction, 8 percentage points) in the EGDT group, allowing for a loss to follow-up or withdrawal of 6%.21\nAll analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle and were prespecified in the statistical analysis plan.22 A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All tests were two-sided with no adjustment for multiple comparisons. Continuous variables are reported as means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges. Categorical variables are reported as proportions.\nWe used Fisher's exact test to compare between-group differences in the primary outcome. Relative and absolute reductions in risk are reported with 95% confidence intervals without adjustment. Secondary analyses of the primary outcome included odds ratio with adjustment for Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS) score components, sensitivity analyses for missing data, learning-curve analysis, and adherence-adjusted analysis. We conducted prespecified subgroup analyses by testing interactions between the effect of EGDT and the degree of protocolized care (in the usual-care group), age, MEDS score,23 SOFA score, and the time from presentation at the emergency department to randomization.\nIn the cost-effectiveness analysis, we reported quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by combining survival data with quality-of-life scores at 90 days and estimated incremental net benefits by valuing incremental QALYs at the recommended threshold for a QALY gain (£20,000 [U.S. $28,430]) and then subtracting the incremental costs from this value.24 Stata/SE software, version 13.\n######################\nOutput:"

        "text": "trial. The North West London Research Ethics Committee approved the study protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded the study and convened a trial steering committee and independent data monitoring and ethics committee. The Clinical Trials Unit at the United Kingdom Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) managed the study (for details, see the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). Edwards Lifesciences loaned monitors and provided training and technical support but had no other role in the study.\nSites and Patients\nThe study was conducted in English NHS hospitals that did not routinely use EGDT that included continuous ScvO2 monitoring. Adults (≥18 years of age) were eligible if within 6 hours after presentation to the emergency department they had a known or presumed infection, two or more criteria of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome,16 and either refractory hypotension (systolic blood pressure, <90 mm Hg; or mean arterial pressure, <65 mm Hg, despite resuscitation with at least 1 liter of intravenous fluids within 60 minutes) or hyperlactatemia (blood lactate level, ≥4 mmol per liter) and did not meet any exclusion criteria (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix).\nRandomization had to be completed within 2 hours after the patient met the inclusion criteria. All patients provided written informed consent, or consent was granted through an agreement with a personal or professional consultee or independent clinician.17 Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio by means of 24-hour telephone randomization to receive either EGDT or usual care. Study-group assignment was performed by means of randomized permuted blocks, with variable block lengths of 4, 6, and 8, and stratified according to site. In all study patients, antimicrobial drugs were initiated before randomization.\nStudy Interventions\nAfter randomization, the usual-care group continued to receive monitoring, investigations, and treatment as determined by the treating clinicians, whereas the EGDT group started the resuscitation protocol (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). For the latter, during the first hour, which was defined as the next whole hour (e.g., if randomization was performed at 9:24, then by 11 o'clock), a central venous catheter capable of continuous ScvO2 monitoring was placed. The resuscitation protocol was followed for 6 hours (intervention period) with personnel involved and treatment location decided according to the site. At least one trained staff member was available throughout the intervention period. Key staff members were trained before the initiation of recruitment at each site. All other treatment, during the intervention period and after, was at the discretion of the treating clinicians. Blinding to study-group assignment was not possible. During the intervention period, data were collected prospectively for the EGDT group and retrospectively for the usual-care group to avoid the influence of data collection on treatment delivery.\nOutcome Measures\nThe primary clinical outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were the score on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)18 at 6 hours and 72 hours; receipt of advanced cardiovascular, advanced respiratory, or renal support and the number of days in the first 28 days after randomization that were free from such support19; length of stay in the emergency department, intensive care unit (ICU), and hospital; duration of survival; all-cause mortality at 28 days, at hospital discharge, and at 1 year; and health-related quality of life (as measured on the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions [EQ-5D] five-level questionnaire), resource use, and costs at 90 days and 1 year. Adverse events were monitored up to 30 days. All definitions are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\nStatistical Analysis\nUsing the ICNARC Case Mix Program Database,20 we estimated that 90-day mortality would be 40% in the usual-care group. On the basis of this estimation, we calculated that an enrollment of 1260 patients would have a power of 80% to detect a relative reduction of 20% in risk (absolute risk reduction, 8 percentage points) in the EGDT group, allowing for a loss to follow-up or withdrawal of 6%.21\nAll analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle and were prespecified in the statistical analysis plan.22 A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All tests were two-sided with no adjustment for multiple comparisons. Continuous variables are reported as means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges. Categorical variables are reported as proportions.\nWe used Fisher's exact test to compare between-group differences in the primary outcome. Relative and absolute reductions in risk are reported with 95% confidence intervals without adjustment. Secondary analyses of the primary outcome included odds ratio with adjustment for Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS) score components, sensitivity analyses for missing data, learning-curve analysis, and adherence-adjusted analysis. We conducted prespecified subgroup analyses by testing interactions between the effect of EGDT and the degree of protocolized care (in the usual-care group), age, MEDS score,23 SOFA score, and the time from presentation at the emergency department to randomization.\nIn the cost-effectiveness analysis, we reported quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by combining survival data with quality-of-life scores at 90 days and estimated incremental net benefits by valuing incremental QALYs at the recommended threshold for a QALY gain (£20,000 [U.S. $28,430]) and then subtracting the incremental costs from this value.24 Stata/SE software, version 13."

More furosemide was given to the conservative-strategy group (Table 2). Dobutamine use was similar and uncommon in both groups (4 percent in the liberal-strategy group and 6 percent in the conservative-strategy group). At least one blood transfusion was given to 29 percent of patients in the conservative-strategy group and to 39 percent of patients in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001). During the study, there was no significant difference in the use of drotrecogin alfa (19 percent in the conservative-strategy group vs. 21 percent in the liberal-strategy group, P=0.70) or systemic corticosteroids (32 percent vs. 37 percent, P=0.09).\nTable 2\n\nFurosemide Dose, Fluid Intake, Fluid Output, and Fluid Balance on Each Day during the Study.\nFluid Balance\nEach study day the liberal-strategy group received more fluid than the conservative-strategy group and on days 1 through 4 had a lower urinary output, resulting in a higher cumulative fluid balance (Table 2). During the study, the seven-day cumulative fluid balance was –136±491 ml in the conservative-strategy group, as compared with 6992±502 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001) (Figure 1 of the Supplementary Appendix). For patients who were in shock at baseline, the cumulative seven-day fluid balance was 2904±1008 ml in the conservative-strategy group and 10,138±922 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001). For patients who were not in shock at baseline, the cumulative fluid balance was −1576±519 ml in the conservative-strategy group and 5287±576 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001).\nHemodynamics\nIntravascular pressures declined in the conservative-strategy group but remained essentially unchanged in the liberal-strategy group (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The conservative-strategy group had a slightly lower mean arterial pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac index, but the heart rate, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and percentage of patients receiving vasopressors did not differ significantly between the two groups (Table 2A in the Supplementary Appendix). For patients in shock at randomization, approximately 40 percent of subsequent measurements met the criteria for shock in both treatment groups. For patients who were not in shock at baseline, there were no significant differences between groups in the incidence of shock during study (32 percent in the liberal-strategy group and 28 percent in the conservative-strategy group, P=0.29) or in the proportions of protocol reassessments classified as shock (6 percent and 7 percent, respectively; P=0.78).\nLung Function\nVentilator settings and lung-function data are shown in Table 2B of the Supplementary Appendix. The conservative-strategy group had better lung injury scores and oxygenation indexes, as well as lower plateau pressures and positive end-expiratory pressures. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, arterial pH, and the PaO2:FiO2 were slightly higher in the conservative-strategy group on all study days, but this difference did not reach significance for the PaO2:FiO2 (P=0.07).\nMetabolic and Renal Function\nThe conservative-strategy group had slightly higher creatinine values than the liberal-strategy group during the study, but this difference did not reach significance (P=0.06) (Table 2C of the Supplementary Appendix). The conservative-strategy group had higher levels of blood urea nitrogen, bicarbonate, hemoglobin, albumin, and calculated colloid osmotic pressure during the study.21 There were no significant differences in mean serum sodium levels during the study.\nSafety\nMetabolic alkalosis and electrolyte imbalances were reported as an adverse event (none with associated arrhythmias) more frequently with the conservative strategy (42 events, 3 serious) than with the liberal strategy (19 events, 1 serious) (P=0.001). More patients in the conservative-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group had at least one potassium value of 3.0 mmol per liter or less (26 percent vs. 22 percent, P<0.001), one sodium value of at least 150 mmol per liter (25 percent vs. 18 percent, P=0.009), or one bicarbonate value of more than 40 mmol per liter (6 percent vs. 2 percent, P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with at least one potassium value of 2.5 mmol per liter or less (4 percent vs. 3 percent, P=0.23).\nMajor Outcomes\nMajor outcomes are shown in Table 3 and Figure 3. There was no interaction between the interventions of the factorial design (type of fluid management and type of catheter, P=0.26). Therefore, results are reported according to the fluid-management strategy, irrespective of catheter assignment. The in-hospital death rate during the first 60 days after randomization was 25.5±1.9 percent in the conservative-strategy group and 28.4±2.0 percent in the liberal-strategy group (P=0.30; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, −2.6 to 8.4 percent). The conservative-strategy group had more ventilator-free days, days free of central nervous system failure, and ICU-free days during the first 28 days. There were no significant differences\n######################\nOutput:"

        "text": ".001), whereas patients in the latter group more often received a fluid bolus (15 percent vs. 6 percent of instructions, P<0.001). More furosemide was given to the conservative-strategy group (Table 2). Dobutamine use was similar and uncommon in both groups (4 percent in the liberal-strategy group and 6 percent in the conservative-strategy group). At least one blood transfusion was given to 29 percent of patients in the conservative-strategy group and to 39 percent of patients in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001). During the study, there was no significant difference in the use of drotrecogin alfa (19 percent in the conservative-strategy group vs. 21 percent in the liberal-strategy group, P=0.70) or systemic corticosteroids (32 percent vs. 37 percent, P=0.09).\nTable 2\n\nFurosemide Dose, Fluid Intake, Fluid Output, and Fluid Balance on Each Day during the Study.\nFluid Balance\nEach study day the liberal-strategy group received more fluid than the conservative-strategy group and on days 1 through 4 had a lower urinary output, resulting in a higher cumulative fluid balance (Table 2). During the study, the seven-day cumulative fluid balance was –136±491 ml in the conservative-strategy group, as compared with 6992±502 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001) (Figure 1 of the Supplementary Appendix). For patients who were in shock at baseline, the cumulative seven-day fluid balance was 2904±1008 ml in the conservative-strategy group and 10,138±922 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001). For patients who were not in shock at baseline, the cumulative fluid balance was −1576±519 ml in the conservative-strategy group and 5287±576 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001).\nHemodynamics\nIntravascular pressures declined in the conservative-strategy group but remained essentially unchanged in the liberal-strategy group (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The conservative-strategy group had a slightly lower mean arterial pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac index, but the heart rate, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and percentage of patients receiving vasopressors did not differ significantly between the two groups (Table 2A in the Supplementary Appendix). For patients in shock at randomization, approximately 40 percent of subsequent measurements met the criteria for shock in both treatment groups. For patients who were not in shock at baseline, there were no significant differences between groups in the incidence of shock during study (32 percent in the liberal-strategy group and 28 percent in the conservative-strategy group, P=0.29) or in the proportions of protocol reassessments classified as shock (6 percent and 7 percent, respectively; P=0.78).\nLung Function\nVentilator settings and lung-function data are shown in Table 2B of the Supplementary Appendix. The conservative-strategy group had better lung injury scores and oxygenation indexes, as well as lower plateau pressures and positive end-expiratory pressures. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, arterial pH, and the PaO2:FiO2 were slightly higher in the conservative-strategy group on all study days, but this difference did not reach significance for the PaO2:FiO2 (P=0.07).\nMetabolic and Renal Function\nThe conservative-strategy group had slightly higher creatinine values than the liberal-strategy group during the study, but this difference did not reach significance (P=0.06) (Table 2C of the Supplementary Appendix). The conservative-strategy group had higher levels of blood urea nitrogen, bicarbonate, hemoglobin, albumin, and calculated colloid osmotic pressure during the study.21 There were no significant differences in mean serum sodium levels during the study.\nSafety\nMetabolic alkalosis and electrolyte imbalances were reported as an adverse event (none with associated arrhythmias) more frequently with the conservative strategy (42 events, 3 serious) than with the liberal strategy (19 events, 1 serious) (P=0.001). More patients in the conservative-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group had at least one potassium value of 3.0 mmol per liter or less (26 percent vs. 22 percent, P<0.001), one sodium value of at least 150 mmol per liter (25 percent vs. 18 percent, P=0.009), or one bicarbonate value of more than 40 mmol per liter (6 percent vs. 2 percent, P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with at least one potassium value of 2.5 mmol per liter or less (4 percent vs. 3 percent, P=0.23).\nMajor Outcomes\nMajor outcomes are shown in Table 3 and Figure 3. There was no interaction between the interventions of the factorial design (type of fluid management and type of catheter, P=0.26). Therefore, results are reported according to the fluid-management strategy, irrespective of catheter assignment. The in-hospital death rate during the first 60 days after randomization was 25.5±1.9 percent in the conservative-strategy group and 28.4±2.0 percent in the liberal-strategy group (P=0.30; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, −2.6 to 8.4 percent). The conservative-strategy group had more ventilator-free days, days free of central nervous system failure, and ICU-free days during the first 28 days. There were no significant differences"

The total amount of administered insulin was not significantly different between the hydrocortisone and placebo groups (safety set analysis: mean [SD], 264.6 [312.2] vs 212.2 [246.8] IU, respectively; difference, 52.4 IU; 95% CI, −21.8 to 126.7 IU; P = .17) (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Two patients developed severe hypertension during hydrocortisone administration, which required antihypertensive therapy. Both patients recovered without sequelae. Secondary infections, weaning failure, muscle weakness, hypernatremia, or other adverse events were not significantly different between treatment groups (Table 3).\n\nCritical Illness–Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency\nCortisol data from corticotropin tests were available from 206 of 353 patients (58.4%), of whom 69 (33.5%) had CIRCI. Baseline characteristics were comparable between patients with and without CIRCI (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). In the placebo group, septic shock occurred in 10 of 37 patients with CIRCI (27.0%) and in 9 of 66 patients without CIRCI (13.6%) (difference, 13.4%; 95% CI, −2.1% to 30.5%; P = .09). In a multivariate analysis, SOFA score (per SOFA point: odds ratio = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.07-1.49; P = .007) and CIRCI (odds ratio = 2.58; 95% CI, 1.13-5.91; P = .03) at baseline, but not age or sex, were independently prognostic for development of septic shock (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). In this subpopulation of 206 patients, there was no significant difference regarding the primary or secondary end points between patients with or without CIRCI who received hydrocortisone or placebo (eTable 6 in Supplement 1).\n\nDelirium\nDelirium was assessed by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU in 286 of 353 patients (81.0%). The median number of assessments per patient was 7 (IQR, 4-12) in the placebo group and 6.5 (IQR, 4-10.5) in the hydrocortisone group (difference, 1.61 assessments; 95% CI, −0.36 to 3.58 assessments; P = .21). Twenty-six patients were excluded from analysis owing to low Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score or incomplete data. In the remaining 260 patients, delirium was less frequent in patients who received hydrocortisone than in those who received placebo (11 of 130 patients [8.5%] vs 25 of 130 patients [19.2%], respectively; difference, −10.8%; 95% CI, −19.2% to −2.3%; P = .01). The results remained significant after exclusion of another 60 patients (28 from the placebo group, 32 from the hydrocortisone group) who were diagnosed by the investigator to have no delirium but had at least 1 incomplete delirium assessment or had only 1 baseline assessment (n = 6 in the hydrocortisone group) (with delirium occurring in 11 of 98 patients [11.2%] in the hydrocortisone group vs 25 of 102 patients [24.5%] in the placebo group; difference, −13.3%; 95% CI, −23.7% to −2.6%; P = .01) (Table 2).\n\nDiscussion\nIn this RCT, low-dose hydrocortisone did not prevent the evolution from severe sepsis to septic shock. There were no significant differences between treatment groups with regard to mortality or LOS in the ICU or hospital, or mortality up to 180 days. Patients treated with hydrocortisone had a significantly higher risk of developing hyperglycemia and a lower risk of developing delirium in a post hoc analysis.\n\nThe rationale for this study was based on the notion that severe sepsis and septic shock reflect stages of a disease continuum with increasing mortality.28 Occurrence of septic shock was chosen as the primary outcome variable for the following reasons. First, hydrocortisone in septic shock showed conflicting results in terms of mortality, but consistent hemodynamic effects and faster septic shock resolution.6,24 Second, administration of hydrocortisone was associated with immunomodulatory effects including reduced inducible nit\n######################\nOutput:"

        "text": "between patients treated with hydrocortisone (n = 24) or placebo (n = 30).\n\nAdverse Effects\nThere were more episodes of hyperglycemia (blood glucose level >150 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]) in the hydrocortisone group (169 of 186 patients [90.9%]) than in the placebo group (154 of 189 patients [81.5%]) (difference, 9.4%; 95% CI, 2.4% to 16.4%; P = .009) (Table 3). The total amount of administered insulin was not significantly different between the hydrocortisone and placebo groups (safety set analysis: mean [SD], 264.6 [312.2] vs 212.2 [246.8] IU, respectively; difference, 52.4 IU; 95% CI, −21.8 to 126.7 IU; P = .17) (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Two patients developed severe hypertension during hydrocortisone administration, which required antihypertensive therapy. Both patients recovered without sequelae. Secondary infections, weaning failure, muscle weakness, hypernatremia, or other adverse events were not significantly different between treatment groups (Table 3).\n\nCritical Illness–Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency\nCortisol data from corticotropin tests were available from 206 of 353 patients (58.4%), of whom 69 (33.5%) had CIRCI. Baseline characteristics were comparable between patients with and without CIRCI (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). In the placebo group, septic shock occurred in 10 of 37 patients with CIRCI (27.0%) and in 9 of 66 patients without CIRCI (13.6%) (difference, 13.4%; 95% CI, −2.1% to 30.5%; P = .09). In a multivariate analysis, SOFA score (per SOFA point: odds ratio = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.07-1.49; P = .007) and CIRCI (odds ratio = 2.58; 95% CI, 1.13-5.91; P = .03) at baseline, but not age or sex, were independently prognostic for development of septic shock (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). In this subpopulation of 206 patients, there was no significant difference regarding the primary or secondary end points between patients with or without CIRCI who received hydrocortisone or placebo (eTable 6 in Supplement 1).\n\nDelirium\nDelirium was assessed by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU in 286 of 353 patients (81.0%). The median number of assessments per patient was 7 (IQR, 4-12) in the placebo group and 6.5 (IQR, 4-10.5) in the hydrocortisone group (difference, 1.61 assessments; 95% CI, −0.36 to 3.58 assessments; P = .21). Twenty-six patients were excluded from analysis owing to low Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score or incomplete data. In the remaining 260 patients, delirium was less frequent in patients who received hydrocortisone than in those who received placebo (11 of 130 patients [8.5%] vs 25 of 130 patients [19.2%], respectively; difference, −10.8%; 95% CI, −19.2% to −2.3%; P = .01). The results remained significant after exclusion of another 60 patients (28 from the placebo group, 32 from the hydrocortisone group) who were diagnosed by the investigator to have no delirium but had at least 1 incomplete delirium assessment or had only 1 baseline assessment (n = 6 in the hydrocortisone group) (with delirium occurring in 11 of 98 patients [11.2%] in the hydrocortisone group vs 25 of 102 patients [24.5%] in the placebo group; difference, −13.3%; 95% CI, −23.7% to −2.6%; P = .01) (Table 2).\n\nDiscussion\nIn this RCT, low-dose hydrocortisone did not prevent the evolution from severe sepsis to septic shock. There were no significant differences between treatment groups with regard to mortality or LOS in the ICU or hospital, or mortality up to 180 days. Patients treated with hydrocortisone had a significantly higher risk of developing hyperglycemia and a lower risk of developing delirium in a post hoc analysis.\n\nThe rationale for this study was based on the notion that severe sepsis and septic shock reflect stages of a disease continuum with increasing mortality.28 Occurrence of septic shock was chosen as the primary outcome variable for the following reasons. First, hydrocortisone in septic shock showed conflicting results in terms of mortality, but consistent hemodynamic effects and faster septic shock resolution.6,24 Second, administration of hydrocortisone was associated with immunomodulatory effects including reduced inducible nit"

The mortality rate was 39.8 percent in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes and 31.0 percent in the group treated with lower tidal volumes (P=0.007; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference between groups, 2.4 to 15.3 percent). The interaction between the study group and stratification for other experimental interventions was not significant (P=0.16).\nFigure 1\n\nProbability of Survival and of Being Discharged Home and Breathing without Assistance during the First 180 Days after Randomization in Patients with Acute Lung Injury and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.\nData were available to calculate the static compliance of the respiratory system at base line in 517 patients (Figure 2). The interaction between the quartile of static compliance at base line and the study group with respect to the risk of death was not significant (P=0.49).\nFigure 2\n\nMean (+SE) Mortality Rate among 257 Patients with Acute Lung Injury and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Who Were Assigned to Receive Traditional Tidal Volumes and 260 Such Patients Who Were Assigned to Receive Lower Tidal Volumes, According to the Quartile of Static Compliance of the Respiratory System before Randomization.\nThe number of ventilator-free days was significantly higher in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes (Table 4). The median duration of ventilation was 8 days among patients in both groups who were discharged from the hospital after weaning and 10.5 and 10 days, respectively, among those who died in the group treated with lower tidal volumes and the group treated with traditional tidal volumes. The number of days without nonpulmonary organ or system failure was significantly higher in the group treated with lower tidal volumes (P=0.006). This group had more days without circulatory failure (mean [±SD], 19±10 vs. 17±11 days; P=0.004), coagulation failure (21±10 vs. 19±11 days, P=0.004), and renal failure (20±11 vs. 18±11 days, P=0.005) than did the group treated with traditional tidal volumes. The incidence of barotrauma after randomization was similar in the two groups.\nTable 4\n\nMain Outcome Variables.\nThere were no significant differences between groups in the percentages of days on which neuromuscular-blocking drugs were used among patients who were discharged home and breathing without assistance (6±14 percent in the group treated with lower tidal volumes and 6±15 percent in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes) or among those who died (20±32 percent and 16±28 percent, respectively), or in the percentages of days on which sedatives were used among patients who were discharged home and breathing without assistance (65±26 percent and 65±24 percent, respectively) or those who died (73±24 percent and 71±28 percent, respectively). Investigational treatments for acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome that were not included in the factorial design of the experimental interventions were given to 15 patients in the group treated with lower tidal volumes and 12 patients in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes. These included prone positioning in 14 and 9 patients, respectively.\nThe mean log-transformed plasma interleukin-6 values decreased from 2.5±0.7 pg per milliliter on day 0 to 2.3±0.7 pg per milliliter on day 3 in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes and from 2.5±0.7 pg per milliliter to 2.0±0.5 pg per milliliter in the group treated with lower tidal volumes. The decrease was greater in the group treated with lower tidal volumes (P<0.001), and the day 3 plasma interleukin-6 concentrations were also lower in this group (P=0.002).\nDiscussion\nIn this large study of patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, mortality was reduced by 22 percent and the number of ventilator-free days was greater in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes. These results are consistent with the results of experiments in animals9–14 and observational studies in humans.16,17\nThese benefits occurred despite the higher requirements for positive end-expiratory pressure and fraction of inspired oxygen and the lower ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen in the group treated with lower tidal volumes on days 1 and 3. These results, coupled with the greater reductions in plasma interleukin-6 concentrations, suggest that the group treated with lower tidal volumes had less lung inflammation.35 The greater reductions in plasma interleukin-6 concentrations may also reflect a reduced systemic inflammatory response to lung injury, which could contribute to the higher number of days without organ or system failure and the lower mortality in the group treated with lower tidal volumes.15\nSeveral factors could explain the difference in results between our trial and other trials of ventilation using lower tidal volumes in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.22–24 First, our study had a greater difference in tidal volumes between groups. In one earlier trial, the traditional tidal volume was equivalent to approximately 12.2 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and the lower tidal volume was equivalent to approximately 8.1 ml per\n######################\nOutput:"

This group had more days without circulatory failure (mean [±SD], 19±10 vs. 17±11 days; P=0.004), coagulation failure (21±10 vs. 19±11 days, P=0.004), and renal failure (20±11 vs. 18±11 days, P=0.005) than did the group treated with traditional tidal volumes. The incidence of barotrauma after randomization was similar in the two groups.\nTable 4\n\nMain Outcome Variables.\nThere were no significant differences between groups in the percentages of days on which neuromuscular-blocking drugs were used among patients who were discharged home and breathing without assistance (6±14 percent in the group treated with lower tidal volumes and 6±15 percent in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes) or among those who died (20±32 percent and 16±28 percent, respectively), or in the percentages of days on which sedatives were used among patients who were discharged home and breathing without assistance (65±26 percent and 65±24 percent, respectively) or those who died (73±24 percent and 71±28 percent, respectively). Investigational treatments for acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome that were not included in the factorial design of the experimental interventions were given to 15 patients in the group treated with lower tidal volumes and 12 patients in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes. These included prone positioning in 14 and 9 patients, respectively.\nThe mean log-transformed plasma interleukin-6 values decreased from 2.5±0.7 pg per milliliter on day 0 to 2.3±0.7 pg per milliliter on day 3 in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes and from 2.5±0.7 pg per milliliter to 2.0±0.5 pg per milliliter in the group treated with lower tidal volumes. The decrease was greater in the group treated with lower tidal volumes (P<0.001), and the day 3 plasma interleukin-6 concentrations were also lower in this group (P=0.002).\nDiscussion\nIn this large study of patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, mortality was reduced by 22 percent and the number of ventilator-free days was greater in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes. These results are consistent with the results of experiments in animals9–14 and observational studies in humans.16,17\nThese benefits occurred despite the higher requirements for positive end-expiratory pressure and fraction of inspired oxygen and the lower ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen in the group treated with lower tidal volumes on days 1 and 3. These results, coupled with the greater reductions in plasma interleukin-6 concentrations, suggest that the group treated with lower tidal volumes had less lung inflammation.35 The greater reductions in plasma interleukin-6 concentrations may also reflect a reduced systemic inflammatory response to lung injury, which could contribute to the higher number of days without organ or system failure and the lower mortality in the group treated with lower tidal volumes.15\nSeveral factors could explain the difference in results between our trial and other trials of ventilation using lower tidal volumes in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.22–24 First, our study had a greater difference in tidal volumes between groups. In one earlier trial, the traditional tidal volume was equivalent to approximately 12.2 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and the lower tidal volume was equivalent to approximately 8.1 ml per"

Although the overall rate of death in the usual-care group was lower than anticipated (29% rather than 40%), it is unlikely that patients in the EGDT group would have a relative reduction of more than 15% in risk. The effect of EGDT was not significantly different in prespecified subgroups. More patients receiving EGDT were admitted to and spent more days in the ICU. Treatment intensity was greater in the EGDT group, driven by adherence to the protocol and indicated by the increased use of central venous catheters, intravenous fluids, vasoactive drugs, and red-cell transfusions. Increased intensity was reflected by significantly higher SOFA scores and more days of receiving advanced cardiovascular support. There were no significant differences in any other secondary outcomes, including health-related quality of life, which was substantially poorer in this severely ill group of patients (0.60) than in the general population matched for age and sex (0.80).25 On average, the use of EGDT increased costs, and given similar QALYs in the two groups, the probability that EGDT was cost-effective was below 20%.\nOur study was set in a real-world context and in a large, representative, mixed sample of approximately one quarter of NHS hospitals in England. Site setup was rapid, and the study recruited the full 1260 patients over a shorter time period than those of the two similar studies in the United States12 and Australasia.13 This factor minimized the potential for other changes in clinical practice to affect outcomes. Unlike previous studies, our study reports on quality of life and cost-effectiveness at 90 days. Loss to follow-up was low, and all analyses were conducted according to a prespecified statistical analysis plan and included adjusted analyses to address the degree of adherence to EGDT and the possibility of the existence of a learning curve for its delivery.\nOur study has several limitations. As in all studies that enroll patients presenting to emergency departments, recruitment was more challenging on weekends and during out-of-office hours; overall, only one third of eligible patients were recruited, although exclusion from the study by a clinician was rare. The intervention could not be blinded, but the risk of bias was minimized through central randomization to ensure the concealment of study-group assignments and the use of a primary outcome that was not subject to observer bias. Since the rate of death was lower than anticipated, our study data may not apply to settings with higher mortality.\nUnlike Rivers et al., in their 2001 study, we did not observe a significant reduction in hospital mortality with the use of EGDT. Many aspects of initial sepsis management have changed during the past 15 years, as can be seen in comparing the usual-care groups. In our study, as compared with the study by Rivers et al., mortality was substantially reduced, randomization occurred later, patients appeared to be less sick at baseline (with lower blood lactate levels and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II scores), and all patients received antibiotics before randomization. In addition, our patients received much lower volumes of intravenous fluids and more vasoactive drugs (Table S20 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nThe level of adherence to EGDT was good and was equivalent to adherence levels in the ProCESS12 and ARISE13 trials and higher than reported rates of compliance with the SSC guidelines.26 Most outcomes were similar to those reported in the ProCESS and ARISE trials, although the rate of death at 90 days that was reported in our study was lower than that in the ProCESS trial but higher than that in the ARISE trial. Of note, a higher proportion of patients in our study than in the ProCESS and ARISE trials met both of the two inclusion criteria — refractory hypotension and hyperlactatemia (Table S21 in the Supplementary Appendix) — a factor that is associated in our national ICU database with a doubling of hospital mortality (Table S22 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that techniques used in usual resuscitation have evolved over the 15 years since the landmark study by Rivers et al.9 In our study, NHS hospitals achieved levels of in-hospital survival in patients receiving usual care that were similar to those achieved with EGDT in the earlier study for patients with septic shock who were identified early and received intravenous antibiotics and adequate fluid resuscitation. The addition of continuous ScvO2 monitoring and strict protocolization did not improve outcomes in the EGDT group. Our results complete the planned trio of studies of EGDT, all of which showed that EGDT was not superior to usual care.\n######################\nOutput:"

The primary outcome was death from any cause at 90 days.\nResults\nFrom March 2013 through April 2017, a total of 3800 patients underwent randomization. Status with respect to the primary outcome was ascertained in 3658 patients (1832 of whom had been assigned to the hydrocortisone group and 1826 to the placebo group). At 90 days, 511 patients (27.9%) in the hydrocortisone group and 526 (28.8%) in the placebo group had died (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.10; P=0.50). The effect of the trial regimen was similar in six prespecified subgroups. Patients who had been assigned to receive hydrocortisone had faster resolution of shock than those assigned to the placebo group (median duration, 3 days [interquartile range, 2 to 5] vs. 4 days [interquartile range, 2 to 9]; hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.41; P<0.001). Patients in the hydrocortisone group had a shorter duration of the initial episode of mechanical ventilation than those in the placebo group (median, 6 days [interquartile range, 3 to 18] vs. 7 days [interquartile range, 3 to 24]; hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.22; P<0.001), but taking into account episodes of recurrence of ventilation, there were no significant differences in the number of days alive and free from mechanical ventilation. Fewer patients in the hydrocortisone group than in the placebo group received a blood transfusion (37.0% vs. 41.7%; odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94; P=0.004). There were no significant between-group differences with respect to mortality at 28 days, the rate of recurrence of shock, the number of days alive and out of the ICU, the number of days alive and out of the hospital, the recurrence of mechanical ventilation, the rate of renal-replacement therapy, and the incidence of new-onset bacteremia or fungemia.\nConclusions\nAmong patients with septic shock undergoing mechanical ventilation, a continuous infusion of hydrocortisone did not result in lower 90-day mortality than placebo. (Funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and others; ADRENAL ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01448109.)\nSepsis, which has been identified by the World Health Organization as a global health priority, has no proven pharmacologic treatment, other than the appropriate antibiotic agents, fluids, and vasopressors as needed; reported death rates among hospitalized patients range between 30% and 45%.1-6 Glucocorticoids have been used as an adjuvant therapy for septic shock for more than 40 years.7 Nonetheless, uncertainty about their safety and efficacy remains.\nRandomized, controlled trials that were conducted in the 1980s showed that the use of high-dose methylprednisolone (30 mg per kilogram of body weight) was associated with higher morbidity and mortality than control.8,9 Two randomized, controlled trials that examined the effect of lower-dose hydrocortisone (200 mg per day) on mortality among patients with septic shock showed conflicting results,10,11 although each trial showed an earlier reversal of shock in patients who had been treated with hydrocortisone than in control patients.\nSubsequent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have not provided compelling evidence for or against the use of hydrocortisone in patients with septic shock.12-14 Current clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of hydrocortisone in patients with septic shock if adequate fluid resuscitation and treatment with vasopressors have not restored hemodynamic stability; however, the guidelines classify the recommendation as weak, on the basis of the low quality of available evidence.15\nThe uncertainty about the efficacy of glucocorticoids in reducing mortality among patients with septic shock has resulted in widespread variation in clinical practice.16 Reports of potential adverse effects associated with glucocorticoids, including superinfection and metabolic and neuromuscular effects, have compounded clinical uncertainty.11 We designed the Adjunctive Corticosteroid Treatment in Critically Ill Patients with Septic Shock (ADRENAL) trial to test the hypothesis that hydrocortisone results in lower mortality than placebo among patients with septic shock.17\nMethods\nTrial Design and Oversight\nOur trial was an investigator-initiated, international, pragmatic, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial that compared intravenous infusions of hydrocortisone with matched placebo in patients with septic shock who were undergoing mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). We conducted the trial in Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, and Denmark.\nThe trial management committee designed the trial. The trial sponsor (the George Institute for Global Health, Australia) coordinated all the operational processes and conducted all the statistical analyses.

Patients were followed for 60 days or until death. The consumption of health care resources (indicated by the duration of vasopressor therapy and mechanical ventilation and the length of the hospital stay) was also examined.\nStatistical Analysis\nIn-hospital mortality was the primary efficacy end point. Secondary end points were the resuscitation end points, organ-dysfunction scores, coagulation-related variables, administered treatments, and the consumption of health care resources. Assuming a rate of refusal or exclusion of 10 percent, a two-sided type I error rate of 5 percent, and a power of 80 percent, we calculated that a sample size of 260 patients was required to permit the detection of a 15 percent reduction in in-hospital mortality. Kaplan–Meier estimates of mortality, along with risk ratios and 95 percent confidence intervals, were used to describe the relative risk of death. Differences between the two groups at base line were tested with the use of Student's t-test, the chi-square test, or Wilcoxon's rank-sum test. Incremental analyses of the area under the curve were performed to quantify differences during the interval from base line to six hours after the start of treatment. For the data at six hours, analysis of covariance was used with the base-line values as the covariates. Mixed models were used to assess the effect of treatment on prespecified secondary variables during the interval from 7 to 72 hours after the start of treatment.27 An independent, 12-member external safety, efficacy, and data monitoring committee reviewed interim analyses of the data after one third and two thirds of the patients had been enrolled and at both times recommended that the trial be continued. To adjust for the two interim analyses, the alpha spending function of DeMets and Lan28 was used to determine that a P value of 0.04 or less would be considered to indicate statistical significance.\nResults\nBase-Line Characteristics\nWe evaluated 288 patients; 8.7 percent were excluded or did not consent to participate. The 263 patients enrolled were randomly assigned to undergo either standard therapy or early goal-directed therapy; 236 patients completed the initial six-hour study period. All 263 were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. The patients assigned to standard therapy stayed a significantly shorter time in the emergency department than those assigned to early goal-directed therapy (mean [±SD], 6.3±3.2 vs. 8.0±2.1 hours; P<0.001). There was no significant difference between the groups in any of the base-line characteristics, including the adequacy and duration of antibiotic therapy (Table 1). Vital signs, resuscitation end points, organ-dysfunction scores, and coagulation-related variables were also similar in the two study groups at base line (Table 2).\nTable 1\n\nBase-Line Characteristics of the Patients.\nTable 2\n\nVital Signs, Resuscitation End Points, Organ-Dysfunction Scores, and Coagulation Variables.\nTwenty-seven patients did not complete the initial six-hour study period (14 assigned to standard therapy and 13 assigned to early goal-directed therapy), for the following reasons: discontinuation of aggressive medical treatment (in 5 patients in each group), discontinuation of aggressive surgical treatment (in 2 patients in each group), a need for immediate surgery (in 4 patients assigned to standard therapy and in 3 assigned to early goal-directed therapy), a need for interventional urologic, cardiologic, or angiographic procedures (in 2 patients in each group), and refusal to continue participation (in 1 patient in each group) (P=0.99 for all comparisons).

During this period, the mean arterial pressure was significantly lower in the group assigned to standard therapy than in the group assigned to early goal-directed therapy (P<0.001), but in both groups the goal of 65 mm Hg or higher was met by all the patients. The goal of 70 percent or higher for central venous oxygen saturation was met by 60.2 percent of the patients in the standard-therapy group, as compared with 94.9 percent of those in the early-therapy group (P<0.001). The combined hemodynamic goals for central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, and urine output (with adjustment for patients with end-stage renal failure) were achieved in 86.1 percent of the standard-therapy group, as compared with 99.2 percent of the early-therapy group (P<0.001).

However, adoption has been limited, and uncertainty about its effectiveness remains.\nMethods\nWe conducted a pragmatic randomized trial with an integrated cost-effectiveness analysis in 56 hospitals in England. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either EGDT (a 6-hour resuscitation protocol) or usual care. The primary clinical outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days.\nResults\nWe enrolled 1260 patients, with 630 assigned to EGDT and 630 to usual care. By 90 days, 184 of 623 patients (29.5%) in the EGDT group and 181 of 620 patients (29.2%) in the usual-care group had died (relative risk in the EGDT group, 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.20; P=0.90), for an absolute risk reduction in the EGDT group of −0.3 percentage points (95% CI, −5.4 to 4.7). Increased treatment intensity in the EGDT group was indicated by increased use of intravenous fluids, vasoactive drugs, and red-cell transfusions and reflected by significantly worse organ-failure scores, more days receiving advanced cardiovascular support, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. There were no significant differences in any other secondary outcomes, including health-related quality of life, or in rates of serious adverse events. On average, EGDT increased costs, and the probability that it was cost-effective was below 20%.\nConclusions\nIn patients with septic shock who were identified early and received intravenous antibiotics and adequate fluid resuscitation, hemodynamic management according to a strict EGDT protocol did not lead to an improvement in outcome. (Funded by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme; ProMISe Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN36307479.)\nThe incidence of severe sepsis and septic shock in adults is estimated to range from 56 to 91 per 100,000 population per year.1 Affected patients have high rates of death, complications, and resource utilization.2–5\nSince 2002, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) has promoted best practice, including early recognition, source control, appropriate and timely antibiotic administration, and resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasoactive drugs.6–8 Resuscitation guidance is largely based on a 2001 single-center, proof-of-concept study by Rivers et al., which indicated that protocolized delivery of 6 hours of early, goal-directed therapy (EGDT) to patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock reduced hospital mortality and hospital stay.9 Such therapy aims to optimize tissue oxygen transport with the use of continuous monitoring of prespecified physiological targets — central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) — to guide delivery of intravenous fluids, vasoactive drugs, and red-cell transfusions.\nHowever, despite the SSC recommendations, the adoption of EGDT has been limited, with concern about the external validity of results from a single center, the complexity of delivery, the potential risks of the components, and resources required for implementation.10,11\nTo address these concerns, multicenter trials of EGDT were conducted in the United States (Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock [ProCESS] trial),12 Australasia (Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation [ARISE] trial),13 and England (Protocolised Management in Sepsis [ProMISe] trial). In all three trials, harmonized methods14 were used to permit subsequent meta-analysis of data from individual patients.15 The two published studies12,13 reported no benefit for EGDT. However, both reported lower-than-anticipated mortality, with a 60-day in-hospital mortality of 18.9% (as compared with an anticipated rate of 30 to 46%) in the ProCESS trial and 90-day mortality of 18.8% (as compared with an anticipated rate of 38%) in the ARISE trial. Consequently, neither trial could rule out the potential for a 20% relative reduction in 90-day mortality for EGDT, as compared with usual care, with a relative risk of 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 1.15) in the ProCESS trial and a relative risk of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.80 to 1.21) in the ARISE trial. We based sample-size calculations for the ProMISe study on a relative risk reduction of 20%.\nThe ProMISe study, which was conducted in a setting in which the reported mortality for septic shock is high and was designed with an integrated economic evaluation, tested the hypothesis that the 6-hour EGDT resuscitation protocol is superior, in terms of clinical and cost-effectiveness measures, to usual care in patients presenting with early septic shock to National Health Service (NHS) emergency departments in England.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Oversight\nOur study was a pragmatic, open, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial. The North West London Research Ethics Committee approved the study protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded the study and convened a trial steering committee and independent data monitoring and ethics committee. The Clinical Trials Unit at the United Kingdom Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) managed the study (for details, see the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org).

The criteria for inclusion were fulfillment of two of four criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and a systolic blood pressure no higher than 90 mm Hg (after a crystalloid-fluid challenge of 20 to 30 ml per kilogram of body weight over a 30-minute period) or a blood lactate concentration of 4 mmol per liter or more. The criteria for exclusion from the study were an age of less than 18 years, pregnancy, or the presence of an acute cerebral vascular event, acute coronary syndrome, acute pulmonary edema, status asthmaticus, cardiac dysrhythmias (as a primary diagnosis), contraindication to central venous catheterization, active gastrointestinal hemorrhage, seizure, drug overdose, burn injury, trauma, a requirement for immediate surgery, uncured cancer (during chemotherapy), immunosuppression (because of organ transplantation or systemic disease), do-not-resuscitate status, or advanced directives restricting implementation of the protocol.\nFigure 1\n\nOverview of Patient Enrollment and Hemodynamic Support.\nThe clinicians who assessed the patients at this stage were unaware of the patients' treatment assignments. After written informed consent was obtained (in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration20), the patients were randomly assigned either to early goal-directed therapy or to standard (control) therapy in computer-generated blocks of two to eight. The study-group assignments were placed in sealed, opaque, randomly assorted envelopes, which were opened by a hospital staff member who was not one of the study investigators.\nTreatment\nThe patients were treated in a nine-bed unit in the emergency department by an emergency physician, two residents, and three nurses.3 The study was conducted during the routine treatment of other patients in the emergency department. After arterial and central venous catheterization, patients in the standard-therapy group were treated at the clinicians' discretion according to a protocol for hemodynamic support21 (Figure 1), with critical-care consultation, and were admitted for inpatient care as soon as possible. Blood, urine, and other relevant specimens for culture were obtained in the emergency department before the administration of antibiotics. Antibiotics were given at the discretion of the treating clinicians. Antimicrobial therapy was deemed adequate if the in vitro sensitivities of the identified microorganisms matched the particular antibiotic ordered in the emergency department.22\nThe patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy received a central venous catheter capable of measuring central venous oxygen saturation (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, Calif.); it was connected to a computerized spectrophotometer for continuous monitoring. Patients were treated in the emergency department according to a protocol for early goal-directed therapy (Figure 2) for at least six hours and were transferred to the first available inpatient beds. Monitoring of central venous oxygen saturation was then discontinued. Critical-care clinicians (intensivists, fellows, and residents providing 24-hour in-house coverage) assumed the care of all the patients; these physicians were unaware of the patients' study-group assignments. The study investigators did not influence patient care in the intensive care unit.\nFigure 2\n\nProtocol for Early Goal-Directed Therapy.\nThe protocol was as follows. A 500-ml bolus of crystalloid was given every 30 minutes to achieve a central venous pressure of 8 to 12 mm Hg. If the mean arterial pressure was less than 65 mm Hg, vasopressors were given to maintain a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mm Hg. If the mean arterial pressure was greater than 90 mm Hg, vasodilators were given until it was 90 mm Hg or below. If the central venous oxygen saturation was less than 70 percent, red cells were transfused to achieve a hematocrit of at least 30 percent. After the central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, and hematocrit were thus optimized, if the central venous oxygen saturation was less than 70 percent, dobutamine administration was started at a dose of 2.5 μg per kilogram of body weight per minute, a dose that was increased by 2.5 μg per kilogram per minute every 30 minutes until the central venous oxygen saturation was 70 percent or higher or until a maximal dose of 20 μg per kilogram per minute was given. Dobutamine was decreased in dose or discontinued if the mean arterial pressure was less than 65 mm Hg or if the heart rate was above 120 beats per minute. To decrease oxygen consumption, patients in whom hemodynamic optimization could not be achieved received mechanical ventilation and sedatives.\nOutcome Measures\nThe patients' temperature, heart rate, urine output, blood pressure, and central venous pressure were measured continuously for the first 6 hours of treatment and assessed every 12 hours for 72 hours. Arterial and venous blood gas values (including central venous oxygen saturation measured by in vitro co-oximetry; Nova Biomedical, Waltham, Mass.), lactate concentrations, and coagulation-related variables and clinical variables required for determination of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score (on a scale from 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction),23 the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II, on a scale from 0 to 174, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction),24 and the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS, on a scale from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction)25 were obtained at base line (0 hours) and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours.2,26 The results of laboratory tests required only for purposes of the study were made\n######################\nOutput:"

The primary site of infection was similar in the two groups and was predominantly of pulmonary origin among patients with a medical diagnosis and of abdominal origin among patients with a surgical admission (Tables S6 and S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\nTrial and Concomitant Regimens\nThe assigned trial regimen was received by 1834 of 1837 patients (99.8%) in the hydrocortisone group and by 1838 of 1843 (99.7%) in the placebo group. The median time from randomization to the commencement of the trial regimen was 0.8 hours (interquartile range, 0.4 to 1.6) in the hydrocortisone group and 0.8 hours (interquartile range, 0.4 to 1.5) in the placebo group (P=0.28). There was no significant between-group difference in the cumulative duration of the trial regimen (median, 5.1 days [interquartile range, 2.7 to 6.8] in the hydrocortisone group and 5.6 days [interquartile range, 2.9 to 6.8] in the placebo group; P=0.09). The overall mean rate of adherence to the dosing protocol was 95.2±11.3% in the hydrocortisone group and 94.9±12.1% in the placebo group (P=0.34) (Table S8 and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nBetween days 1 and 14 after randomization, 138 of 1853 patients (7.4%) in the hydrocortisone group and 164 of 1860 (8.8%) in the placebo group received open-label glucocorticoids (P=0.13). The use of inotropes, vasopressors, etomidate, statins, and antimicrobial therapies did not differ significantly between the groups (Tables S8 and S9 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nBetween days 1 and 7, patients in the hydrocortisone group had a higher mean arterial pressure than did those in the placebo group (difference, 5.39 mm Hg; P<0.001), as well as a higher plasma lactate level (difference, 0.08 mmol per liter; P=0.02) and a lower heart rate (difference, −6.6 beats per minute; P<0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in the daily peak dose of norepinephrine among patients who were receiving vasopressors between days 1 and 14. (Details are provided in Fig. S4A through S4E in the Supplementary Appendix.)\nPrimary Outcome\nAt 90 days after randomization, 511 of 1832 patients (27.9%) who had been assigned to receive hydrocortisone had died, as had 526 of 1826 (28.8%) who had been assigned to receive placebo (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.10; P=0.50) (Table 2, and Table S10 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of death in the time-to-event analysis during the 90 days after randomization (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.07; P=0.42) (Figure 1A).\nFigure 1\n\nRate of Survival and the Risk of Death at 90 Days, According to Subgroup.\nTable 2\n\nOutcomes.\nThere was no significant heterogeneity in the effect of the trial regimen on the primary outcome in the six prespecified subgroups (Figure 1B). A post hoc sensitivity analysis that excluded patients who had received open-label glucocorticoids did not alter the primary outcome result (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.12; P=0.59).\nSecondary Outcomes\nThere was no significant between-group difference in mortality at 28 days (Table 2, and Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). The time to the resolution of shock was shorter in the hydrocortisone group than in the placebo group (median, 3 days [interquartile range, 2 to 5] vs. 4 days [interquartile range, 2 to 9]; hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.41; P<0.001) (Figure 2, and Fig. S6A and S6B in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nCumulative Incidence Function of Time from Randomization to Resolution of Shock.\nThe time to discharge from the ICU was shorter in the hydrocortisone group than in the placebo group (median, 10 days [interquartile range, 5 to 30] vs. 12 days [interquartile range, 6 to 42]; hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.23; P<0.001) (Fig. S6C and S6D in the Supplementary Appendix).

The patient was considered to be in shock if the mean arterial pressure was less than 70 mm Hg or the systolic blood pressure was less than 100 mm Hg despite the fact that an adequate amount of fluids (at least 1000 ml of crystalloids or 500 ml of colloids) had been administered (unless there was an elevation in the central venous pressure to >12 mm Hg or in pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure to >14 mm Hg) and if there were signs of tissue hypoperfusion (e.g., altered mental state, mottled skin, urine output of <0.5 ml per kilogram of body weight for 1 hour, or a serum lactate level of >2 mmol per liter). Patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years of age; had already received a vasopressor agent (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, or phenylephrine) for more than 4 hours during the current episode of shock; had a serious arrhythmia, such as rapid atrial fibrillation (>160 beats per minute) or ventricular tachycardia; or had been declared brain-dead.\nProtocol\nRandomization was performed in computer-generated, permuted blocks of 6 to 10, stratified according to the participating ICU. Treatment assignments and a five-digit reference number were placed in sealed, opaque envelopes, which were opened by the person responsible for the preparation of the trial-drug solutions. The solutions of norepinephrine or dopamine were prepared in vials or syringes according to the preference of the local ICU. Each vial or syringe was then labeled with its randomly allocated number. The doctors and nurses administering the drugs, as well as the local investigators and research personnel who collected data, were unaware of the treatment assignments. The trial was approved by the ethics committee at each participating center. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or next of kin.\nThe dose was determined according to the patient's body weight. Doses of dopamine could be increased or decreased by 2 μg per kilogram per minute and doses of norepinephrine by 0.02 μg per kilogram per minute (or more in emergency cases) (see Figure 1 and Figure 2 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). An example of the dose-escalation table is provided in Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix. The target blood pressure was determined by the doctor in charge for each individual patient. If the patient was still hypotensive after the maximum dose of either agent had been administered (20 μg per kilogram per minute for dopamine or 0.19 μg per kilogram per minute for norepinephrine — doses that have been shown to have similar effects on mean arterial blood pressure12,13), open-label norepinephrine was added. The dose of 20 μg per kilogram per minute for dopamine was selected as the maximal dose because this upper limit was the standard of care in the participating ICUs, in line with expert recommendations14 and international guidelines.15\nIf the patient was already being treated with a vasopressor at baseline, that agent was replaced as soon as possible with the trial-drug solution. If the patient was already receiving dopamine and this agent could not be discontinued after introduction of the trial-drug solution, the dopamine was replaced with an open-label norepinephrine infusion. Open-label dopamine was not allowed at any time. Epinephrine and vasopressin were used only as rescue therapy. Inotropic agents could be used, if needed, to increase cardiac output.\nWhen the patients were weaned from vasopressor agents, any open-label norepinephrine that was being administered was withdrawn first, after which the trial-drug solution was withdrawn. If hypotension recurred, the trial-drug solution was resumed first (at the same maximal dose) and an open-label solution of norepinephrine was added if needed.\nThe study period lasted a maximum of 28 days. The study drug was reinstituted, if necessary, in patients who were discharged from the ICU but were readmitted within 28 days after randomization, allowing maximal exposure to the study drug. After day 28, the choice of vasopressor agent was left to the discretion of the physician in charge.\nIf adverse events occurred during treatment with the study drug, the physician in charge could withdraw the patient from the study and switch him or her to open-label vasopressor therapy. All other treatment decisions were left to the discretion of the attending physicians.\nEnd Points\nThe primary end point of the trial was the rate of death at 28 days. Secondary end points were the rates of death in the ICU, in the hospital, at 6 months, and at 12 months; the duration of stay in the ICU; the number of days without need for organ support (i.e., vasopressors, ventilators, or renal-replacement therapy); the time to attainment of hemodynamic stability (i.e., time to reach a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg)16; the changes in hemodynamic variables; and the use of dobutamine or other inotropic agents. Adverse events were categorized as arrhythmias (i.e., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or atrial fibrillation), myocardial necrosis, skin necrosis, ischemia in limbs or distal extremities, or secondary infections.17\nMeasured Variables\nThe following data were recorded every 6 hours for 48 hours, every 8 hours on days 3, 4,\n######################\nOutput:"

We conducted the trial in Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, and Denmark.\nThe trial management committee designed the trial. The trial sponsor (the George Institute for Global Health, Australia) coordinated all the operational processes and conducted all the statistical analyses. Trained research coordinators collected data at each site and entered the information into a Web-based database. Data monitoring and source-data verification were conducted according to a prespecified monitoring plan (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).\nBefore enrollment was completed, we published the trial protocol (available at NEJM.org) and statistical analysis plan.17,18 Approval from a human research ethics committee was obtained for all the sites before enrollment of the patients. Previous written informed consent or written consent to continue was obtained for all participants, according to the legal requirements in each jurisdiction. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and statistical analyses and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.\nNeither Pfizer (which supplied hydrocortisone) nor Radpharm Scientific (which supplied placebo) had any input into the design or conduct of the study, data collection, statistical analysis, or writing of the manuscript. Mater Pharmacy Services (Brisbane, Australia) was responsible for acquisition of the drugs and the blinding processes. There was no contractual arrangement between the trial sponsor, the George Institute for Global Health, and either Pfizer or Radpharm Scientific. All contractual arrangements were between Mater Pharmacy Services and the George Institute for Global Health.\nPatients\nEligible participants were adults (≥18 years of age) who were undergoing mechanical ventilation, for whom there was a documented or strong clinical suspicion of infection, who fulfilled two or more criteria of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome,19 and who had been treated with vasopressors or inotropic agents for a minimum of 4 hours up to and at the time of randomization. Patients were excluded if they were likely to receive treatment with systemic glucocorticoids for an indication other than septic shock, had received etomidate20 (a short-acting anesthetic agent with adrenal-suppressant properties) during the current hospital admission, were considered to be likely to die from a preexisting disease within 90 days after randomization or had treatment limitations in place, or had met all the inclusion criteria for more than 24 hours. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria and the alignment of these criteria with the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)21 are provided in Tables S2A through S2C in the Supplementary Appendix.\nRandomization and Trial Regimen\nWe concealed the randomized trial-group assignments using a minimization algorithm by means of a password-protected, encrypted, Web-based interface. Randomization was stratified according to participating center and according to medical or surgical admission. Surgical admissions were defined as patients being admitted to the ICU from the operating room or the recovery room; all other admissions were considered to be medical admissions.\nPatients were assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of hydrocortisone (Pfizer) at a dose of 200 mg per day or matching placebo (Radpharm Scientific). Blinding regarding the trial regimen was ensured by the supply of hydrocortisone and placebo in identical, masked vials. The integrity of the trial-group assignment was confirmed by an independent person who assessed a random sample of hydrocortisone and placebo packs from 10% of the trial population (Table S3A in the Supplementary Appendix). The trial regimen was reconstituted to produce a concentration of 1 mg per milliliter of hydrocortisone or an equivalent volume (in milliliters) of placebo. The trial dose volume was set at 200 ml, which was administered by means of continuous intravenous infusion over a period of 24 hours for a maximum of 7 days or until ICU discharge or death, whichever occurred first. A description of the blinding process and of the preparation and reconstitution of the trial regimen is provided in Table S3B in the Supplementary Appendix.\nThe patients, treating clinicians, and trial personnel were unaware of the trial-group assignments and sequence. All other aspects of the patients’ care were conducted at the discretion of the treating clinicians.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was death from any cause at 90 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes included death from any cause at 28 days after randomization, the time to the resolution of shock,22 the recurrence of shock, the length of ICU stay, the length of hospital stay, the frequency and duration of mechanical ventilation, the frequency and duration of treatment with renal-replacement therapy, the incidence of new-onset bacteremia or fungemia between 2 and 14 days after randomization, and the receipt of blood transfusion in the ICU. Definitions of the secondary outcomes are provided in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe determined that a population of 3800 patients would provide the trial with 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 5 percentage points in 90-day all-cause mortality from an estimated baseline mortality of 33%, at an alpha level of 0.05.6 This calculation allowed for a rate of withdrawal and loss to follow-up of 1%.\nThe primary-outcome result is presented as the odds ratio for death, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, analyzed with the use of a logistic-regression model with adjustment for stratification variables, with admission type (medical or surgical) as a fixed effect and trial site as a random effect. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed by adding the following covariates to the main logistic-regression model: sex;\n######################\nOutput:"

(Details about methods are provided in the Statistical Analysis section in the Supplementary Appendix.)\nResults\nStudy Patients\nFrom February 16, 2011, to July 24, 2014, we screened 6192 patients at 56 sites (including 29% that are teaching hospitals), which resulted in the enrollment of 1260 patients (Tables S1 and S2 and Fig. S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Four patients requested complete withdrawal and five were ineligible, which left 1251 patients in the initial analysis (625 in the EGDT group and 626 in the usual-care group). Eight patients withdrew before 90 days, which left 1243 patients in the analysis of outcomes (623 in the EGDT group and 620 in the usual-care group) (Figure 1, and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The two study groups were well matched at baseline (Table 1, and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 1\n\nEnrollment and Outcomes.\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\nThe criterion for refractory hypotension was met in 338 patients (54.1%) in the EGDT group and 348 patients (55.6%) in the usual-care group, and the criterion for hyperlactatemia was met in 409 patients (65.4%) and 399 patients (63.7%), respectively. The intravenous-fluid volume before randomization was similar in the two groups, as were median times from presentation at the emergency department until inclusion criteria were met and until randomization. Only about two thirds of patients in either group were deemed likely to be admitted to the ICU from the emergency department if they were not enrolled in the study; those deemed unlikely to be admitted were less severely ill. The sites of infection (most commonly lung) were well balanced in the two groups. All patients received antimicrobial drugs before randomization.\nAdherence to the Protocol\nMost patients in the EGDT group underwent timely insertion of a central venous catheter capable of continuous ScvO2 monitoring. Two catheters that were inserted in error in the usual-care group were not used for monitoring ScvO2 (Table 2, and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the EGDT group, reasons for failure of insertion were as follows: patient no longer met inclusion criteria or met exclusion criteria (22 patients), there was a lapse in the process of care (lack of equipment, staff, beds, communication, or error) (20 patients), there were technical difficulties or problems with a patient (18 patients), there was a decision by a clinician (9 patients), or the patient declined to have a catheter inserted but did not withdraw from the trial (5 patients); in 4 patients, no reason was provided, and 2 patients died before catheter insertion. The mean (±SD) first ScvO2 value recorded (at hour 1) was 70±12% (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Standard central venous catheters were not mandated but were placed in 50.9% of the patients in the usual-care group, and ScvO2 was measured from aspirated blood samples in 6 patients. Arterial catheters were also not mandated but were placed in most patients.\nTable 2\n\nInterventions Delivered during and after the 6-Hour Intervention Period.\nEGDT was stopped prematurely in 21 patients (median time to cessation, 3 hours) because active treatment was withdrawn (9 patients), the patient was no longer considered to have sepsis (5 patients), or EGDT was terminated in error (3 patients); in addition, 1 patient was transferred to an operating room, 1 patient declined treatment, and no reason was provided for 2 patients. Among the 35 patients who died within 6 hours (17 in the EGDT group and 18 in the usual-care group), 5 in the EGDT group and 6 in the usual-care group had withdrawal of active treatment. Adherence to EGDT ranged from 86 to 95%, depending on the method of assessment (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nIntervention Period\nDuring the 6-hour intervention period, patients in the EGDT group received more intravenous fluids than did patients in the usual-care group (Table 2). Hourly fluid volume decreased over the 6 hours, but patients in the usual-care group received a larger initial volume (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). Crystalloids were administered more frequently than colloids in the two groups. More patients in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group received vasopressors and dobutamine. Although more patients in the EGDT group received red-cell transfusions, larger volumes were transfused in the usual-care group. During the 6-hour intervention period, administration of platelets and fresh-frozen plasma was similar in the two groups, although the volume of each was higher in the EGDT group (Table 2). At 6 hours, values for central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, and hemoglobin were similar in the two groups among patients in whom they were measured, which happened with greater frequency in the EGDT group (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nAfter the\n######################\nOutput:"

(Details about methods are provided in the Statistical Analysis section in the Supplementary Appendix.)\nResults\nStudy Patients\nFrom February 16, 2011, to July 24, 2014, we screened 6192 patients at 56 sites (including 29% that are teaching hospitals), which resulted in the enrollment of 1260 patients (Tables S1 and S2 and Fig. S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Four patients requested complete withdrawal and five were ineligible, which left 1251 patients in the initial analysis (625 in the EGDT group and 626 in the usual-care group). Eight patients withdrew before 90 days, which left 1243 patients in the analysis of outcomes (623 in the EGDT group and 620 in the usual-care group) (Figure 1, and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The two study groups were well matched at baseline (Table 1, and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 1\n\nEnrollment and Outcomes.\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\nThe criterion for refractory hypotension was met in 338 patients (54.1%) in the EGDT group and 348 patients (55.6%) in the usual-care group, and the criterion for hyperlactatemia was met in 409 patients (65.4%) and 399 patients (63.7%), respectively. The intravenous-fluid volume before randomization was similar in the two groups, as were median times from presentation at the emergency department until inclusion criteria were met and until randomization. Only about two thirds of patients in either group were deemed likely to be admitted to the ICU from the emergency department if they were not enrolled in the study; those deemed unlikely to be admitted were less severely ill. The sites of infection (most commonly lung) were well balanced in the two groups. All patients received antimicrobial drugs before randomization.\nAdherence to the Protocol\nMost patients in the EGDT group underwent timely insertion of a central venous catheter capable of continuous ScvO2 monitoring. Two catheters that were inserted in error in the usual-care group were not used for monitoring ScvO2 (Table 2, and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the EGDT group, reasons for failure of insertion were as follows: patient no longer met inclusion criteria or met exclusion criteria (22 patients), there was a lapse in the process of care (lack of equipment, staff, beds, communication, or error) (20 patients), there were technical difficulties or problems with a patient (18 patients), there was a decision by a clinician (9 patients), or the patient declined to have a catheter inserted but did not withdraw from the trial (5 patients); in 4 patients, no reason was provided, and 2 patients died before catheter insertion. The mean (±SD) first ScvO2 value recorded (at hour 1) was 70±12% (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Standard central venous catheters were not mandated but were placed in 50.9% of the patients in the usual-care group, and ScvO2 was measured from aspirated blood samples in 6 patients. Arterial catheters were also not mandated but were placed in most patients.\nTable 2\n\nInterventions Delivered during and after the 6-Hour Intervention Period.\nEGDT was stopped prematurely in 21 patients (median time to cessation, 3 hours) because active treatment was withdrawn (9 patients), the patient was no longer considered to have sepsis (5 patients), or EGDT was terminated in error (3 patients); in addition, 1 patient was transferred to an operating room, 1 patient declined treatment, and no reason was provided for 2 patients. Among the 35 patients who died within 6 hours (17 in the EGDT group and 18 in the usual-care group), 5 in the EGDT group and 6 in the usual-care group had withdrawal of active treatment. Adherence to EGDT ranged from 86 to 95%, depending on the method of assessment (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nIntervention Period\nDuring the 6-hour intervention period, patients in the EGDT group received more intravenous fluids than did patients in the usual-care group (Table 2). Hourly fluid volume decreased over the 6 hours, but patients in the usual-care group received a larger initial volume (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).

However, of the patients who survived to hospital discharge, those assigned to standard therapy had stayed a significantly longer time in the hospital than those assigned to early goal-directed therapy (18.4±15.0 vs. 14.6±14.5 days, P=0.04).\nDiscussion\nSevere sepsis and septic shock are common and are associated with substantial mortality and substantial consumption of health care resources. There are an estimated 751,000 cases (3.0 cases per 1000 population) of sepsis or septic shock in the United States each year, and they are responsible for as many deaths each year as acute myocardial infarction (215,000, or 9.3 percent of all deaths).29 In elderly persons, the incidence of sepsis or septic shock and the related mortality rates are substantially higher than those in younger persons. The projected growth of the elderly population in the United States will contribute to an increase in incidence of 1.5 percent per year, yielding an estimated 934,000 and 1,110,000 cases by the years 2010 and 2020, respectively.29 The present annual cost of this disease is estimated to be $16.7 billion.29\nThe transition from the systemic inflammatory response syndrome to severe sepsis and septic shock involves a myriad of pathogenic changes, including circulatory abnormalities that result in global tissue hypoxia.1,2 These pathogenic changes have been the therapeutic target of previous outcome studies.12 Although this transition occurs over time, both out of the hospital and in the hospital, in outcome studies interventions have usually been initiated after admission to the intensive care unit.12 In studies of goal-directed hemodynamic optimization, in particular, there was no benefit in terms of outcome with respect to normal and supranormal hemodynamic end points, as well as those guided by mixed venous oxygen saturation.9,13 In contrast, even though we enrolled patients with lower central venous oxygen saturation and lower central venous pressure than those studied by Gattinoni et al.9 and with a higher lactate concentration than those studied by Hayes et al.,13 we found significant benefits with respect to outcome when goal-directed therapy was applied at an earlier stage of disease. In patients with septic shock, for example, Hayes et al. observed a higher in-hospital mortality rate with aggressive hemodynamic optimization in the intensive care unit (71 percent) than with control therapy (52 percent), whereas we observed a lower mortality rate in patients with septic shock assigned to early goal-directed therapy (42.3 percent) than in those assigned to standard therapy (56.8 percent).\nThe benefits of early goal-directed therapy in terms of outcome are multifactorial. The incidence of death due to sudden cardiovascular collapse in the standard-therapy group was approximately double that in the group assigned to early goal-directed therapy, suggesting that an abrupt transition to severe disease is an important cause of early death. The early identification of patients with insidious illness (global tissue hypoxia accompanied by stable vital signs) makes possible the early implementation of goal-directed therapy. If sudden cardiovascular collapse can be prevented, the subsequent need for vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and pulmonary-artery catheterization (and their associated risks) diminishes. In addition to being a stimulus of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, global tissue hypoxia independently contributes to endothelial activation and disruption of the homeostatic balance among coagulation, vascular permeability, and vascular tone.30 These are key mechanisms leading to microcirculatory failure, refractory tissue hypoxia, and organ dysfunction.2,30 When early therapy is not comprehensive, the progression to severe disease may be well under way at the time of admission to the intensive care unit.16 Aggressive hemodynamic optimization and other therapy12 undertaken thereafter may be incompletely effective or even deleterious.13\nThe value of measurements of venous oxygen saturation at the right atrium or superior vena cava (central venous oxygen saturation) instead of at the pulmonary artery (mixed venous oxygen saturation) has been debated,31 in particular, when saturation values are above 65 percent. In patients in the intensive care unit who have hyperdynamic septic shock, the mixed venous oxygen saturation is rarely below 65 percent.32 In contrast, our patients were examined during the phase of resuscitation in which the delivery of supplemental oxygen is required (characterized by a decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation and an increased lactate concentration), when the central venous oxygen saturation generally exceeds the mixed venous oxygen saturation.33,34 The initial central venous oxygen saturation was less than 50 percent in both study groups. The mixed venous oxygen saturation is estimated to be 5 to 13 percent lower in the pulmonary artery33 and 15 percent lower in the splanchnic bed.35 Though not numerically equivalent, these ranges of values are pathologically equivalent and are associated with high mortality.32,36 Among all the patients in the current study in whom the goals with respect to central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, and urine output during the first six hours were met, 39.8 percent of those assigned to standard therapy were still in this oxygen-dependent phase of resuscitation at six hours, as compared with 5.1 percent of those\n######################\nOutput:"

However, of the patients who survived to hospital discharge, those assigned to standard therapy had stayed a significantly longer time in the hospital than those assigned to early goal-directed therapy (18.4±15.0 vs. 14.6±14.5 days, P=0.04).\nDiscussion\nSevere sepsis and septic shock are common and are associated with substantial mortality and substantial consumption of health care resources. There are an estimated 751,000 cases (3.0 cases per 1000 population) of sepsis or septic shock in the United States each year, and they are responsible for as many deaths each year as acute myocardial infarction (215,000, or 9.3 percent of all deaths).29 In elderly persons, the incidence of sepsis or septic shock and the related mortality rates are substantially higher than those in younger persons. The projected growth of the elderly population in the United States will contribute to an increase in incidence of 1.5 percent per year, yielding an estimated 934,000 and 1,110,000 cases by the years 2010 and 2020, respectively.29 The present annual cost of this disease is estimated to be $16.7 billion.29\nThe transition from the systemic inflammatory response syndrome to severe sepsis and septic shock involves a myriad of pathogenic changes, including circulatory abnormalities that result in global tissue hypoxia.1,2 These pathogenic changes have been the therapeutic target of previous outcome studies.12 Although this transition occurs over time, both out of the hospital and in the hospital, in outcome studies interventions have usually been initiated after admission to the intensive care unit.12 In studies of goal-directed hemodynamic optimization, in particular, there was no benefit in terms of outcome with respect to normal and supranormal hemodynamic end points, as well as those guided by mixed venous oxygen saturation.9,13 In contrast, even though we enrolled patients with lower central venous oxygen saturation and lower central venous pressure than those studied by Gattinoni et al.9 and with a higher lactate concentration than those studied by Hayes et al.,13 we found significant benefits with respect to outcome when goal-directed therapy was applied at an earlier stage of disease. In patients with septic shock, for example, Hayes et al. observed a higher in-hospital mortality rate with aggressive hemodynamic optimization in the intensive care unit (71 percent) than with control therapy (52 percent), whereas we observed a lower mortality rate in patients with septic shock assigned to early goal-directed therapy (42.3 percent) than in those assigned to standard therapy (56.8 percent).\nThe benefits of early goal-directed therapy in terms of outcome are multifactorial. The incidence of death due to sudden cardiovascular collapse in the standard-therapy group was approximately double that in the group assigned to early goal-directed therapy, suggesting that an abrupt transition to severe disease is an important cause of early death. The early identification of patients with insidious illness (global tissue hypoxia accompanied by stable vital signs) makes possible the early implementation of goal-directed therapy. If sudden cardiovascular collapse can be prevented, the subsequent need for vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and pulmonary-artery catheterization (and their associated risks) diminishes. In addition to being a stimulus of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, global tissue hypoxia independently contributes to endothelial activation and disruption of the homeostatic balance among coagulation, vascular permeability, and vascular tone.30 These are key mechanisms leading to microcirculatory failure, refractory tissue hypoxia, and organ dysfunction.2,30 When early therapy is not comprehensive, the progression to severe disease may be well under way at the time of admission to the intensive care unit.16 Aggressive hemodynamic optimization and other therapy12 undertaken thereafter may be incompletely effective or even deleterious.13\nThe value of measurements of venous oxygen saturation at the right atrium or superior vena cava (central venous oxygen saturation) instead of at the pulmonary artery (mixed venous oxygen saturation) has been debated,31 in particular, when saturation values are above 65 percent. In patients in the intensive care unit who have hyperdynamic septic shock, the mixed venous oxygen saturation is rarely below 65 percent.32 In contrast, our patients were examined during the phase of resuscitation in which the delivery of supplemental oxygen is required (characterized by a decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation and an increased lactate concentration), when the central venous oxygen saturation generally exceeds the mixed venous oxygen saturation.33,34 The initial central venous oxygen saturation was less than 50 percent in both study groups. The mixed venous oxygen saturation is estimated to be 5 to 13 percent lower in the pulmonary artery33 and 15 percent lower in the splanchnic bed.35 Though not numerically equivalent, these ranges of values are pathologically equivalent and are associated with high mortality.32,36 Among all the patients in the current study in whom the goals with respect to central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, and urine output during the first six hours were met, 39.8 percent of those assigned to standard therapy were still in this oxygen-dependent phase of resuscitation at six hours, as compared with 5.1 percent of those"

We also recorded the number of lung quadrants involved on chest radiography, results of measurements of arterial blood gases, PplatRS, arterial blood lactate levels, the cause of ARDS, the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score16 (which ranges from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more severe organ failure), the lung injury score (which ranges from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe lung injury),17 and the time at which the first prone session was started.\nThe following events were recorded daily until day 28: attempts at extubation, administration of inhaled nitric oxide, infusion of almitrine bismesylate, use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), infusion of sedatives and neuromuscular blockers, complications, and the SOFA score. Ventilator settings, PplatRS, static compliance of the respiratory system, and the results of measurements of arterial blood gases were recorded daily during the first week as indicated above. Data quality was verified by the research fellows, and data were stored in a database (Clininfo) that was specifically developed for the study with the use of Epi Info software, version 3.4.3.\nOutcome Measures\nThe primary end point was mortality at day 28. Secondary end points were mortality at day 90, the rate of successful extubation, the time to successful extubation, the length of stay in the ICU, complications, the use of noninvasive ventilation, the tracheotomy rate, the number of days free from organ dysfunction, and ventilator settings, measurements of arterial blood gases, and respiratory-system mechanics during the first week after randomization.\nSuccessful extubation was defined as no reintubation or use of noninvasive ventilation in the 48 hours after extubation. In patients who had undergone a tracheotomy, successful weaning from the ventilator was defined as the ability to breathe unassisted through the tracheostomy cannula for at least 24 hours.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe expected 28-day mortality in the supine group was 60%. We estimated that with a sample of 456 patients, the study would have 90% power to detect an absolute reduction of 15 percentage points (to 45%) with prone positioning, at a one-sided type I error rate of 5%.\nAn interim analysis was planned 28 days after half the patients had been enrolled, and two analyses were scheduled, each with a type I error rate set to 2.5% to maintain an overall type I error rate of 5%. The statistician sent the data from the interim analysis to the data and safety monitoring board, which had to decide whether to continue or discontinue the trial. An absolute difference in mortality of 25 percentage points or more between groups at the time of the interim analysis was the only criterion for early trial termination. There was no stopping rule for futility.\nThe analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Continuous variables were expressed as means with standard deviations. Data were compared between groups with the use of the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and analysis of variance as indicated. Patient survival was analyzed with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method and compared between groups with the use of the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards regression, with stratification according to center, was planned to adjust the between-group differences in mortality at day 28 and day 90 for significant baseline covariates. The statistical analysis was performed with the use of SPSS software (SPSS for Windows, version 17.0). The investigators had no access to the database until the study was completed. All reported P values are two-sided, and have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.\nResults\nParticipants\nFrom January 1, 2008, through July 25, 2011, a total of 3449 patients with ARDS were admitted to the participating ICUs, and 474 underwent randomization (Figure 1). Eight patients were subsequently excluded (Figure 1), and 466 patients were included in the analysis: 229 in the supine group and 237 in the prone group. After the interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board recommended that the trial be continued.\nFigure 1\n\nEnrollment, Randomization, and Follow-up of the Study Participants.\nCharacteristics at Inclusion\nThe characteristics of the patients at inclusion in the study were similar in the two groups except for the SOFA score and the use of neuromuscular blockers and vasopressors (Table 1). In more than half the cases, the main cause of ARDS was pneumonia (Table 1). Influenza A (H1N1) virus infection was the main cause of ARDS in 28 patients, with no significant difference between the groups in the rate (5.7% in the supine group and 6.3% in the prone group, P=0.85). The mean (±SD) time from intubation to randomization was 31±26 hours in the supine group and 33±24 hours in the prone group (P=0.66). The lung injury score was 3.3±0.4 in both groups, and the rate of use of noninvasive ventilation in the 24 hours before inclusion was similar in the two groups (29.3% and 30.8% in the supine and prone groups\n######################\nOutput:"

        "text": "), ventilator settings, time from intubation to randomization, height, predicted body weight, and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II15 (which ranges from 0 to 164, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms). We also recorded the number of lung quadrants involved on chest radiography, results of measurements of arterial blood gases, PplatRS, arterial blood lactate levels, the cause of ARDS, the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score16 (which ranges from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more severe organ failure), the lung injury score (which ranges from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe lung injury),17 and the time at which the first prone session was started.\nThe following events were recorded daily until day 28: attempts at extubation, administration of inhaled nitric oxide, infusion of almitrine bismesylate, use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), infusion of sedatives and neuromuscular blockers, complications, and the SOFA score. Ventilator settings, PplatRS, static compliance of the respiratory system, and the results of measurements of arterial blood gases were recorded daily during the first week as indicated above. Data quality was verified by the research fellows, and data were stored in a database (Clininfo) that was specifically developed for the study with the use of Epi Info software, version 3.4.3.\nOutcome Measures\nThe primary end point was mortality at day 28. Secondary end points were mortality at day 90, the rate of successful extubation, the time to successful extubation, the length of stay in the ICU, complications, the use of noninvasive ventilation, the tracheotomy rate, the number of days free from organ dysfunction, and ventilator settings, measurements of arterial blood gases, and respiratory-system mechanics during the first week after randomization.\nSuccessful extubation was defined as no reintubation or use of noninvasive ventilation in the 48 hours after extubation. In patients who had undergone a tracheotomy, successful weaning from the ventilator was defined as the ability to breathe unassisted through the tracheostomy cannula for at least 24 hours.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe expected 28-day mortality in the supine group was 60%. We estimated that with a sample of 456 patients, the study would have 90% power to detect an absolute reduction of 15 percentage points (to 45%) with prone positioning, at a one-sided type I error rate of 5%.\nAn interim analysis was planned 28 days after half the patients had been enrolled, and two analyses were scheduled, each with a type I error rate set to 2.5% to maintain an overall type I error rate of 5%. The statistician sent the data from the interim analysis to the data and safety monitoring board, which had to decide whether to continue or discontinue the trial. An absolute difference in mortality of 25 percentage points or more between groups at the time of the interim analysis was the only criterion for early trial termination. There was no stopping rule for futility.\nThe analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Continuous variables were expressed as means with standard deviations. Data were compared between groups with the use of the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and analysis of variance as indicated. Patient survival was analyzed with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method and compared between groups with the use of the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards regression, with stratification according to center, was planned to adjust the between-group differences in mortality at day 28 and day 90 for significant baseline covariates. The statistical analysis was performed with the use of SPSS software (SPSS for Windows, version 17.0). The investigators had no access to the database until the study was completed. All reported P values are two-sided, and have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.\nResults\nParticipants\nFrom January 1, 2008, through July 25, 2011, a total of 3449 patients with ARDS were admitted to the participating ICUs, and 474 underwent randomization (Figure 1). Eight patients were subsequently excluded (Figure 1), and 466 patients were included in the analysis: 229 in the supine group and 237 in the prone group. After the interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board recommended that the trial be continued.\nFigure 1\n\nEnrollment, Randomization, and Follow-up of the Study Participants.\nCharacteristics at Inclusion\nThe characteristics of the patients at inclusion in the study were similar in the two groups except for the SOFA score and the use of neuromuscular blockers and vasopressors (Table 1). In more than half the cases, the main cause of ARDS was pneumonia (Table 1). Influenza A (H1N1) virus infection was the main cause of ARDS in 28 patients, with no significant difference between the groups in the rate (5.7% in the supine group and 6.3% in the prone group, P=0.85). The mean (±SD) time from intubation to randomization was 31±26 hours in the supine group and 33±24 hours in the prone group (P=0.66). The lung injury score was 3.3±0.4 in both groups, and the rate of use of noninvasive ventilation in the 24 hours before inclusion was similar in the two groups (29.3% and 30.8% in the supine and prone groups"

A subgroup analysis of patients with CAP showed most effects in patients who had low basal cortisol levels combined with high proinflammatory cytokine profiles.32\n\nThe results from this study do not support an increased risk for secondary infections. Reasonable concerns were amplified by results of the CORTICUS trial, which showed higher numbers of secondary infections including new sepsis and septic shock in patients who received hydrocortisone.4 A Bayesian analysis, mainly based on CORTICUS results, of patients with septic shock reported an increased risk of infections.33 However, other studies in patients with septic shock,3 acute respiratory distress syndrome,34 trauma,35 or CAP8-10,30 and a meta-analysis7 did not report any increased risk.\n\nAn unexpected finding was that delirium developed less frequently in patients treated with hydrocortisone. Indeed, several observational studies reported an association between high serum cortisol concentration and delirium after noncardiac36 and cardiac 37 surgery and severe sepsis or septic shock.38 There is compelling evidence that systemic inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of delirium, but it remains controversial whether high cortisol concentration mirrors an activation of the stress response to cope with inflammation, or whether delirium is caused by high cortisol concentration. A prospective cohort study in 330 mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung injury reported a significant dose-independent association between systemic corticosteroid administration and development of delirium.39 However, in an RCT with 737 patients undergoing cardiac surgery who received dexamethasone, 1 mg/kg, or placebo at anesthesia induction did not reveal a significant difference of postoperative delirium between treatment groups.40 Thus, the results question the concept of cortisol-induced delirium in critical illness and provide some evidence of protective effects of prolonged administration of low-dose hydrocortisone in early severe sepsis.\n\nThere are limitations of the study to be addressed. First, inclusion in the trial was possible only after informed consent could be obtained, so that patients who developed septic shock early may have been missed. Second, data from corticotropin tests were available in a subgroup of 206 patients only, because adrenal function assessment was not an absolute inclusion criterion and therefore was not performed at all study sites or in all patients at a single site. Analyses of CIRCI were post hoc and should be regarded as hypothesis generating only. Third, mortality in the study population was more comparable to the mortality reported in recent studies with CAP9,10,30 than to the mortality (approximately 30%) reported in the study by Confalonieri et al8; thus, it cannot be excluded that hydrocortisone would have been more effective in patients with a higher risk of death. Fourth, data on delirium should be interpreted with caution because patients had to be excluded owing to incomplete data sets, only 1 daily assessment was performed in most patients, and interrater reliability was not assessed. Analyses were performed post hoc and results should therefore be regarded as hypothesis generating. Fifth, secondary analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing, as these statistical comparisons were performed with exploratory rather than confirmatory intention. Adjustment for clustering within site was not performed because site was a stratification factor for randomization. Sixth, the observed rate of septic shock in the placebo group (23%; 95% CI, 17%-30%) was lower than originally presumed for sample size calculation (40%). The point estimate of the difference of septic shock occurrences was −1.8% (ie, close to 0) with a 95% CI of −10.7% to 7.2%. Hence, the trial gives no indication of a clinically relevant major benefit of hydrocortisone treatment, which it was designed to detect.\n\nConclusions\nAmong adults with severe sepsis not in septic shock, the use of hydrocortisone compared with placebo did not reduce the risk of septic shock within 14 days. These findings do not support the use of hydrocortisone in these patients.\n######################\nOutput:"

        "text": "needs further investigation. A subgroup analysis of patients with CAP showed most effects in patients who had low basal cortisol levels combined with high proinflammatory cytokine profiles.32\n\nThe results from this study do not support an increased risk for secondary infections. Reasonable concerns were amplified by results of the CORTICUS trial, which showed higher numbers of secondary infections including new sepsis and septic shock in patients who received hydrocortisone.4 A Bayesian analysis, mainly based on CORTICUS results, of patients with septic shock reported an increased risk of infections.33 However, other studies in patients with septic shock,3 acute respiratory distress syndrome,34 trauma,35 or CAP8-10,30 and a meta-analysis7 did not report any increased risk.\n\nAn unexpected finding was that delirium developed less frequently in patients treated with hydrocortisone. Indeed, several observational studies reported an association between high serum cortisol concentration and delirium after noncardiac36 and cardiac 37 surgery and severe sepsis or septic shock.38 There is compelling evidence that systemic inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of delirium, but it remains controversial whether high cortisol concentration mirrors an activation of the stress response to cope with inflammation, or whether delirium is caused by high cortisol concentration. A prospective cohort study in 330 mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung injury reported a significant dose-independent association between systemic corticosteroid administration and development of delirium.39 However, in an RCT with 737 patients undergoing cardiac surgery who received dexamethasone, 1 mg/kg, or placebo at anesthesia induction did not reveal a significant difference of postoperative delirium between treatment groups.40 Thus, the results question the concept of cortisol-induced delirium in critical illness and provide some evidence of protective effects of prolonged administration of low-dose hydrocortisone in early severe sepsis.\n\nThere are limitations of the study to be addressed. First, inclusion in the trial was possible only after informed consent could be obtained, so that patients who developed septic shock early may have been missed. Second, data from corticotropin tests were available in a subgroup of 206 patients only, because adrenal function assessment was not an absolute inclusion criterion and therefore was not performed at all study sites or in all patients at a single site. Analyses of CIRCI were post hoc and should be regarded as hypothesis generating only. Third, mortality in the study population was more comparable to the mortality reported in recent studies with CAP9,10,30 than to the mortality (approximately 30%) reported in the study by Confalonieri et al8; thus, it cannot be excluded that hydrocortisone would have been more effective in patients with a higher risk of death. Fourth, data on delirium should be interpreted with caution because patients had to be excluded owing to incomplete data sets, only 1 daily assessment was performed in most patients, and interrater reliability was not assessed. Analyses were performed post hoc and results should therefore be regarded as hypothesis generating. Fifth, secondary analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing, as these statistical comparisons were performed with exploratory rather than confirmatory intention. Adjustment for clustering within site was not performed because site was a stratification factor for randomization. Sixth, the observed rate of septic shock in the placebo group (23%; 95% CI, 17%-30%) was lower than originally presumed for sample size calculation (40%). The point estimate of the difference of septic shock occurrences was −1.8% (ie, close to 0) with a 95% CI of −10.7% to 7.2%. Hence, the trial gives no indication of a clinically relevant major benefit of hydrocortisone treatment, which it was designed to detect.\n\nConclusions\nAmong adults with severe sepsis not in septic shock, the use of hydrocortisone compared with placebo did not reduce the risk of septic shock within 14 days. These findings do not support the use of hydrocortisone in these patients."

We did not administer fludrocortisone, because it has been shown previously to be ineffective.36\nOur trial had limitations. Within the context of a large pragmatic trial, we collected data on only adverse events that had been judged by the treating clinicians to be related to the trial regimen, and we did not adjudicate this judgment. This approach may weaken the inferences about adverse events. We did not collect data regarding all possible secondary infections, and we recorded only bacteremia and fungemia, which are less subject to diagnostic error or ascertainment bias. We did not adjudicate the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy. We used rates of recurrence of ventilation as a surrogate for myopathy but did not assess long-term neuromuscular weakness.\nOur trial provides evidence about the role of hydrocortisone as an adjunctive treatment in patients with septic shock. Although we did not observe a significant difference between the hydrocortisone group and the placebo group with regard to 90-day mortality, some secondary outcomes were better in the group that received the active treatment. Our observation of the hemodynamic effects of hydrocortisone is consistent with those in previous studies.37-39 These hemodynamic effects may represent a beneficial role of hydrocortisone. There was a lower incidence of transfusion in the hydrocortisone group than in the placebo group, a finding that may be regarded as hypothesis-generating. A detailed cost–benefit assessment of these results was not done, but such an analysis may inform clinicians about the overall cost-effectiveness of hydrocortisone in patients with septic shock.\nIn conclusion, in patients with septic shock who were undergoing mechanical ventilation, the administration of a continuous infusion of hydrocortisone did not result in lower mortality at 90 days than placebo.\n######################\nOutput:"

Additional sensitivity analyses were performed by adding the following covariates to the main logistic-regression model: sex; age; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, assessed on a scale from 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of death23; the time from the onset of shock to randomization; and the use of renal-replacement therapy in the 24 hours before randomization.\nThe primary outcome was also examined in six prespecified subgroups, which were defined according to the following baseline characteristics: admission type (medical vs. surgical); dose of catecholamine infusions (norepinephrine or epinephrine at a dose of <15 μg per minute vs. ≥15 μg per minute); primary site of sepsis (pulmonary vs. nonpulmonary); sex (male vs. female); APACHE II score (<25 vs. ≥25; a score of ≥25 has been used as a cutoff point to identify patients at a higher risk for death24,25); and the duration of shock according to four intervals of 6 hours each between 0 and 24 hours before randomization (<6 hours, 6 to 12 hours, 12 to 18 hours, or 18 to 24 hours). The secondary binary and continuous outcomes were analyzed with the use of logistic regression and linear regression, respectively, with adjustment for stratification variables. The rate of death in a time-to-event analysis was reported with the use of Kaplan–Meier plots, and differences in survival were tested with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model26 that included the randomized trial group, admission type, and a random effect for trial site.\nThe times to the resolution of shock and ventilation and the times to discharge from the ICU and the hospital were analyzed by means of two approaches: with death treated as a competing risk27 and with results described with the use of cumulative incidence function; and as a post hoc analysis with data from patients censored at the time of death and with results described with the use of Kaplan–Meier plots. Differences in the time to event (e.g., resolution of shock, cessation of ventilation, and ICU or hospital discharge) were tested with the use of the same Cox model that was used for the analysis of time to death.\nPhysiological data were averaged over the period of days 1 to 14 and compared with the use of a repeated-measure, linear mixed model and were presented as overall mean differences with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Post hoc analyses were performed with the use of a separate calculation of the mean differences over the period of days 1 to 7 (duration of trial regimen) and days 8 to 14. The proportions of patients who had adverse events and serious adverse events were compared with the use of Fisher’s exact test.\nAll the analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis with no imputation of missing data. For secondary outcomes, a post hoc Holm–Bonferroni procedure was applied to control for multiple testing.28 All the analyses were conducted with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\nTwo prespecified interim analyses were performed by an independent statistician when 950 patients (25%) and 2500 patients (66%) could be assessed with regard to the primary outcome at 90 days. These analyses were reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee.\nResults\nPatients\nFrom March 2013 through April 2017, we identified 5501 eligible patients, of whom 3800 were enrolled in the trial at 69 medical–surgical ICUs. The ICUs were in Australia (45 sites), the United Kingdom (12), New Zealand (8), Saudi Arabia (3), and Denmark (1).\nOf the 3800 patients enrolled, 1898 were assigned to receive hydrocortisone and 1902 to receive placebo. A total of 114 patients (3.0%) either withdrew (24 patients) or did not have informed consent obtained (90), and 28 of the remaining 3686 patients (0.8%) were lost to follow-up at 90 days. Thus, the trial included 3658 enrolled patients, of whom 1832 in the hydrocortisone group and 1826 in the placebo group were included in the analysis of the primary outcome (Figs. S1 and S2 and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nThe characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar in the two groups (Table 1). The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 62.3±14.9 years in the hydrocortisone group and 62.7±15.2 years in the placebo group; the percentages of male patients were 60.4% and 61.3%, respectively; the median APACHE II scores were 24.0 (interquartile range, 19.0 to 29.0) and 23.0 (interquartile range, 18.0 to 29.0), respectively; and the percentages of patients with surgical admission were 31.2% and 31.8%, respectively. The primary site of infection was similar in the two groups and was predominantly of pulmonary origin among patients with a medical diagnosis and of abdominal origin among patients with a surgical admission (Tables S6 and S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients at\n######################\nOutput:"

The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death from any cause.\nResults\nOn the recommendation of the data monitoring committee, we stopped the trial after 548 of a planned 1200 patients had undergone randomization. The two study groups were well matched at baseline. The HFOV group underwent HFOV for a median of 3 days (interquartile range, 2 to 8); in addition, 34 of 273 patients (12%) in the control group received HFOV for refractory hypoxemia. In-hospital mortality was 47% in the HFOV group, as compared with 35% in the control group (relative risk of death with HFOV, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.64; P=0.005). This finding was independent of baseline abnormalities in oxygenation or respiratory compliance. Patients in the HFOV group received higher doses of midazolam than did patients in the control group (199 mg per day [interquartile range, 100 to 382] vs. 141 mg per day [interquartile range, 68 to 240], P<0.001), and more patients in the HFOV group than in the control group received neuromuscular blockers (83% vs. 68%, P<0.001). In addition, more patients in the HFOV group received vasoactive drugs (91% vs. 84%, P=0.01) and received them for a longer period than did patients in the control group (5 days vs. 3 days, P=0.01).\nConclusions\nIn adults with moderate-to-severe ARDS, early application of HFOV, as compared with a ventilation strategy of low tidal volume and high positive end-expiratory pressure, does not reduce, and may increase, in-hospital mortality. (Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Current Controlled Trials numbers, ISRCTN42992782 and ISRCTN87124254, and ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT00474656 and NCT01506401.)\nThe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common complication of critical illness.1,2 Mortality is high, and survivors often have long-term complications.3,4 Although mechanical ventilation is life-sustaining for patients with ARDS, it can perpetuate lung injury. Basic research suggests that repetitive overstretching or collapse of lung units with each respiratory cycle can generate local and systemic inflammation, contributing to multiorgan failure and death.5 Consistent with these findings are data from clinical trials that support the use of smaller tidal volumes (6 vs. 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight)6 and higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).7–10 Mortality remains high, however, and additional therapies are needed to protect the lung in cases of severe ARDS.11,12\nOne such approach is high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), which delivers very small tidal volumes (approximately 1 to 2 ml per kilogram13) at very high rates (3 to 15 breaths per second).14–19 Previous randomized trials of the use of HFOV in adults with ARDS have suggested that this strategy results in improvements in oxygenation and survival, but the trials were limited by small sample sizes and outdated ventilation strategies for the control group.20–22 Consequently, despite the frequent use of HFOV in patients who do not have an adequate response to conventional mechanical ventilation and the increased use of HFOV earlier in the course of the disease, this approach remains an unproven therapy for adults with ARDS.23–26 We therefore compared HFOV with a conventional ventilation strategy that used low tidal volumes and high levels of PEEP in patients with new-onset, moderate-to-severe ARDS.\nMethods\nStudy Oversight\nFor the pilot phase of the study, we enrolled patients at 11 centers in Canada and 1 in Saudi Arabia from July 2007 through June 2008; for the main trial, we enrolled patients at the same centers and at an additional 27 centers in Canada, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Chile, and India from July 2009 through August 2012 (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The trial protocol, which is available at NEJM.org, was approved by the research ethics board at each participating site.

For HFOV, we used the SensorMedics 3100B High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilator (CareFusion); the manufacturer loaned nine ventilators and provided technical support but had no role in the design of the study, the collection or analysis of the data, or the preparation of the manuscript.\nPatients\nPatients were eligible for inclusion if they had had an onset of pulmonary symptoms within the previous 2 weeks, had undergone tracheal intubation, had hypoxemia (defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO2] to the fraction of inspired oxygen [\n######################\nOutput:"

In one earlier trial, the traditional tidal volume was equivalent to approximately 12.2 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and the lower tidal volume was equivalent to approximately 8.1 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight.23 In a second study, the traditional and lower tidal volumes were approximately 10.3 and 7.1 ml per kilogram of dry body weight (calculated as the measured weight minus the estimated weight gain from fluid retention), respectively.22 In the present trial, measured weight exceeded predicted body weight by approximately 20 percent. Assuming a similar difference, and assuming that half the difference was dry weight in excess of predicted body weight, tidal volumes in the second trial would have been approximately 11.3 and 7.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. Therefore, the traditional tidal volume of 11.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight in our study was similar to the values in the previous two trials. However, the tidal volume of 6.2 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight in the group receiving lower tidal volumes was lower than the values in the previous two trials.\nIf one assumes that measured weights also exceeded predicted body weights by 20 percent in the earlier trials, the tidal volumes in the traditional groups were approximately 10.2 and 9.4 ml per kilogram of measured weight, respectively, as compared with 9.9 ml per kilogram of measured weight in our study. Therefore, the tidal volumes in the traditional groups in each of the three trials were consistent with traditional recommendations.6,36\nA second possible explanation for the different results is that the previous trials were designed to detect larger differences in mortality between groups.22–24 Hence, they lacked the statistical power to demonstrate the moderate effects of lower tidal volumes that we found.\nA third difference in the trials was in the treatment of acidosis. Increases in the ventilator rate were required and bicarbonate infusions were allowed to correct mild-to-moderate acidosis in our study, which resulted in smaller differences in the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and pH between the study groups than in the previous trials.22–24 The deleterious effects of acidosis in the previous studies may have counteracted a protective effect of the lower tidal volumes.\nIn addition to being caused by excessive stretch, lung injury may also result from repeated opening and closing of small airways or from excessive stress at margins between aerated and atelectatic regions of the lungs.37 These types of lung injury may be prevented by the use of a higher positive end-expiratory pressure.10,13,37,38 A slightly higher positive end-expiratory pressure was necessary in the group treated with lower tidal volumes during the first few days to maintain arterial oxygenation at a level similar to that in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes, but positive end-expiratory pressure was not increased as a means of protecting the lungs.\nIn a recent trial in 53 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, 28-day mortality was significantly lower with a ventilation strategy that used a higher positive end-expiratory pressure combined with limited peak inspiratory pressure than with a strategy of traditional ventilation.21 These results suggest that both increased positive end-expiratory pressure and reduced inspiratory stretch could have beneficial effects.\nStretch-induced lung injury may not occur if lung compliance is not greatly reduced. However, the benefit of ventilation with a lower tidal volume was independent of the static compliance of the respiratory system at base line, suggesting that the lower tidal volume was advantageous regardless of lung compliance. Variations in chest-wall compliance, which contributes to compliance of the respiratory system and is reduced in many patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome,39 may have obscured a true interaction between tidal volume and base-line lung compliance.\nBarotrauma occurred with similar frequency in the two study groups, a finding consistent with the results of other studies in which the incidence of barotrauma was independent of airway pressures.22–24,40,41 The most common manifestation of barotrauma was pneumothorax, which could have been the result of invasive procedures. Pneumothorax is not a sensitive or specific marker of stretch-induced injury with the tidal volumes used in this study.\nThe similarity in the number of days of ventilator use among the survivors in both groups suggests that the higher number of ventilator-free days in the group treated with lower tidal volumes resulted from reduced mortality rather than from a reduced number of days of ventilation among the survivors. However, the comparison of the number of days of ventilator use among the survivors could be misleading.42 Some patients who would have survived in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes might have needed the ventilator on fewer days had they been in the group treated with lower tidal volumes. This beneficial effect would have been obscured if prolonged ventilation was required before recovery among patients who otherwise would have died in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes. For similar reasons, it is also difficult to compare the number of days with organ or system failure among the survivors in the two study groups.\nWe found that treatment with a ventilation approach designed to protect the lungs from excessive stretch resulted in improvements in several important clinical outcomes in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome. On the basis of these results, high priority should be given to preventing excessive lung stretch during adjustments to mechanical ventilation, and this lower-tidal-volume protocol should be used in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nNotes\nSupported by contracts (NO1-HR 46054, 46055, 46056,\n######################\nOutput:"

Data collectors were aware of the study-group assignments, but outcomes assessors were not.\nThe trial was overseen by a steering committee that met monthly. An independent data and safety monitoring board, comprising three experts in the field, was also set up (a list of board members is provided in the Supplementary Appendix). There was no commercial support. No one who is not listed as an author contributed to the writing of this manuscript. All authors vouch for the accuracy of the data and analysis and the fidelity of the study to the protocol.\nProtocol\nAfter a patient was determined to be eligible, a stabilization period of 12 to 24 hours was mandated. Inclusion in the study was confirmed only at the end of this period (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nPatients assigned to the prone group had to be turned to the prone position within the first hour after randomization. They were placed in a completely prone position for at least 16 consecutive hours. Participating centers were given guidelines (see the Supplementary Appendix) to ensure standardization of prone placement. Standard ICU beds were used for all patients. Patients assigned to the supine group remained in a semirecumbent position.\nMechanical ventilation13 was delivered in a volume-controlled mode with constant inspiratory flow, with tidal volume targeted at 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight13 and the PEEP level selected from a PEEP–FiO2 table14 (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The goal was to maintain an end-inspiratory plateau pressure of the respiratory system (PplatRS), measured after a 1-second period of no air flow, of no more than 30 cm of water and an arterial plasma pH of 7.20 to 7.45. Physiological variables were measured at predetermined times in both groups. In the supine group, measurements were performed every 6 hours; in the prone group, measurements were performed just before the patient was turned to the prone position, after 1 hour of prone positioning, just before the patient was turned back to the supine position, and 4 hours after the patient was returned to the supine position. Adjustments of ventilator settings in specific situations are detailed in the Supplementary Appendix.\nThe criteria for stopping prone treatment were any of the following: improvement in oxygenation (defined as a PaO2:FiO2 ratio of ≥150 mm Hg, with a PEEP of ≤10 cm of water and an FiO2 of ≤0.6; in the prone group, these criteria had to be met in the supine position at least 4 hours after the end of the last prone session); a decrease in the PaO2:FiO2 ratio of more than 20%, relative to the ratio in the supine position, before two consecutive prone sessions; or complications occurring during a prone session and leading to its immediate interruption. Complications leading to the immediate interruption of prone treatment included nonscheduled extubation, main-stem bronchus intubation, endotracheal-tube obstruction, hemoptysis, oxygen saturation of less than 85% on pulse oximetry or a PaO2 of less than 55 mm Hg for more than 5 minutes when the FiO2 was 1.0, cardiac arrest, a heart rate of less than 30 beats per minute for more than 1 minute, a systolic blood pressure of less than 60 mm Hg for more than 5 minutes, and any other life-threatening reason for which the clinician decided to stop the treatment.\nAfter patients in the prone group were turned to the supine position, the prone session could be resumed at any time before the planned assessment at 4 hours in the supine position if the criteria for oxygen saturation level, PaO2, or both were met. The prone-positioning strategy was applied every day up to day 28, after which it was used at the clinician's discretion. Patients in the supine group could not be crossed over to the prone group except as a rescue measure in case of life-threatening hypoxemia when all the following criteria were met simultaneously: a PaO2:FiO2 ratio of less than 55 mm Hg, with an FiO2 of 1.0; maximal PEEP according to the PEEP–FiO2 table; administration of inhaled nitric oxide at a concentration of 10 ppm; infusion of intravenous almitrine bismesylate at a dose of 4 μg per kilogram per minute; and performance of respiratory recruitment maneuvers to increase the amount of aerated lung.\nWeaning from mechanical ventilation was conducted in the same way for both groups (see the Supplementary Appendix). Details regarding the management of sedation and the use of neuromuscular blocking agents are also provided in the Supplementary Appendix. The investigators assessed patients at least every morning until day 28 or discharge from the ICU.\nData Collection\nAt the time of admission, we recorded data on age, sex, the setting from which the patient was admitted to the ICU, the context for admission to the ICU, McCabe score14 (which ranges from A to C, with A indicating no underlying disease that compromises life expectancy, B an estimated life expectancy with the chronic disease of <5 years, and C an estimated life expectancy with the chronic disease of <1 year), ventilator settings, time from intubation to randomization, height, predicted body weight, and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II15 (which ranges from 0 to 164, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms). We also recorded the number of lung quadrants involved on chest radiography, results of measurements of arterial blood gases, PplatRS, arterial blood lactate levels, the cause of ARDS, the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment\n######################\nOutput:"

This approach involves adjustments of cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility to balance oxygen delivery with oxygen demand. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of early goal-directed therapy before admission to the intensive care unit.\nMethods\nWe randomly assigned patients who arrived at an urban emergency department with severe sepsis or septic shock to receive either six hours of early goal-directed therapy or standard therapy (as a control) before admission to the intensive care unit. Clinicians who subsequently assumed the care of the patients were blinded to the treatment assignment. In-hospital mortality (the primary efficacy outcome), end points with respect to resuscitation, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores were obtained serially for 72 hours and compared between the study groups.\nResults\nOf the 263 enrolled patients, 130 were randomly assigned to early goal-directed therapy and 133 to standard therapy; there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to base-line characteristics. In-hospital mortality was 30.5 percent in the group assigned to early goal-directed therapy, as compared with 46.5 percent in the group assigned to standard therapy (P=0.009). During the interval from 7 to 72 hours, the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy had a significantly higher mean (±SD) central venous oxygen saturation (70.4±10.7 percent vs. 65.3±11.4 percent), a lower lactate concentration (3.0±4.4 vs. 3.9±4.4 mmol per liter), a lower base deficit (2.0±6.6 vs. 5.1±6.7 mmol per liter), and a higher pH (7.40±0.12 vs. 7.36±0.12) than the patients assigned to standard therapy (P≤0.02 for all comparisons). During the same period, mean APACHE II scores were significantly lower, indicating less severe organ dysfunction, in the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy than in those assigned to standard therapy (13.0±6.3 vs. 15.9±6.4, P<0.001).\nConclusions\nEarly goal-directed therapy provides significant benefits with respect to outcome in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.\nThe systemic inflammatory response syndrome can be self-limited or can progress to severe sepsis and septic shock.1 Along this continuum, circulatory abnormalities (intravascular volume depletion, peripheral vasodilatation, myocardial depression, and increased metabolism) lead to an imbalance between systemic oxygen delivery and oxygen demand, resulting in global tissue hypoxia or shock.2 An indicator of serious illness, global tissue hypoxia is a key development preceding multiorgan failure and death.2 The transition to serious illness occurs during the critical “golden hours,” when definitive recognition and treatment provide maximal benefit in terms of outcome. These golden hours may elapse in the emergency department,3 hospital ward,4 or the intensive care unit.5\nEarly hemodynamic assessment on the basis of physical findings, vital signs, central venous pressure,6 and urinary output7 fails to detect persistent global tissue hypoxia. A more definitive resuscitation strategy involves goal-oriented manipulation of cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility to achieve a balance between systemic oxygen delivery and oxygen demand.2 End points used to confirm the achievement of such a balance (hereafter called resuscitation end points) include normalized values for mixed venous oxygen saturation, arterial lactate concentration, base deficit, and pH.8 Mixed venous oxygen saturation has been shown to be a surrogate for the cardiac index as a target for hemodynamic therapy.9 In cases in which the insertion of a pulmonary-artery catheter is impractical, venous oxygen saturation can be measured in the central circulation.10\nWhereas the incidence of septic shock has steadily increased during the past several decades, the associated mortality rates have remained constant or have decreased only slightly.11 Studies of interventions such as immunotherapy,12 hemodynamic optimization,9,13 or pulmonary-artery catheterization14 enrolled patients up to 72 hours after admission to the intensive care unit. The negative results of studies of the use of hemodynamic variables as end points (“hemodynamic optimization”), in particular, prompted suggestions that future studies involve patients with similar causes of disease13 or with global tissue hypoxia (as reflected by elevated lactate concentrations)15 and that they examine interventions begun at an earlier stage of disease.16,17\nWe examined whether early goal-directed therapy before admission to the intensive care unit effectively reduces the incidence of multiorgan dysfunction, mortality, and the use of health care resources among patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.\nMethods\nApproval of Study Design\nThis prospective, randomized study was approved by the institutional review board for human research and was conducted under the auspices of an independent safety, efficacy, and data monitoring committee.\nEligibility\nEligible adult patients who presented to the emergency department of an 850-bed academic tertiary care hospital with severe sepsis, septic shock, or the sepsis syndrome from March 1997 through March 2000 were assessed for possible enrollment according to the inclusion18,19 and exclusion criteria (Figure 1). The criteria for inclusion were fulfillment of two of four criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and a systolic blood pressure no higher than 90 mm Hg (after a crystalloid-fluid challenge of 20 to 30 ml per kilogram of body weight over a 30-minute period) or a blood lactate concentration of 4 mmol per liter or more.

Physiologic and radiographic data, medication use, and use of other investigational treatments were recorded between 6 and 10 a.m. on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Data were transmitted weekly to the network coordinating center. Patients were followed until day 180 or until they were breathing on their own at home.\nAssessment of Compliance\nRandomly selected ventilator and blood gas variables were analyzed for compatibility with the protocol. Quarterly reports of these data from each of the 10 centers were used by investigators to assess compliance.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe first primary outcome was death before a patient was discharged home and was breathing without assistance. Patients who were in other types of health care facilities at 180 days were considered to have been discharged from the hospital and to be breathing without assistance. The second primary outcome was ventilator-free days, defined as the number of days from day 1 to day 28 on which a patient breathed without assistance, if the period of unassisted breathing lasted at least 48 consecutive hours. A difference in ventilator-free days could reflect a difference in mortality, ventilator days among survivors, or both. Other outcomes were the number of days without organ or system failure and the occurrence of barotrauma, defined as any new pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or subcutaneous emphysema, or a pneumatocele that was more than 2 cm in diameter. Interim analyses were conducted by an independent data and safety monitoring board after the enrollment of each successive group of approximately 200 patients. Stopping boundaries (with a two-sided α level of 0.05) were designed to allow early termination of the study if the use of lower tidal volumes was found to be either efficacious31 or ineffective.32\nThe comparison of traditional with lower tidal volumes was one of two trials conducted simultaneously in the same patients in a factorial experimental design. Ketoconazole was compared with placebo in the first 234 patients, and lisofylline was compared with placebo in the last 194 patients; no drugs were assessed in the middle 433 patients.\nWe used Student's t-test or Fisher's exact test to compare base-line variables. We used analysis of covariance to compare log-transformed plasma interleukin-6 values. We used Wilcoxon's test to compare the day 0 and day 3 plasma interleukin-6 concentrations, ventilator-free days, and organ-failure–free days, which had skewed distributions. We used the 180-day cumulative incidence of mortality to compare the proportion of patients in each group who died before being discharged home and breathing without assistance,33 after stratification for other experimental interventions: treatment with ketoconazole, the ketoconazole placebo, lisofylline, the lisofylline placebo, or no other agent. We used a chi-square test to determine whether there was an interaction between the study group and the other experimental interventions with respect to the mean (±SE) mortality rates at 180 days. All P values are two-sided.\nResults\nThe trial was stopped after the fourth interim analysis because the use of lower tidal volumes was found to be efficacious (P=0.005 for the difference in mortality between groups; P value for the stopping boundary, 0.023). The base-line characteristics of the 861 patients who were enrolled were similar, except that minute ventilation was slightly but significantly higher (P=0.01) in the group treated with lower tidal volumes (Table 2).\nTable 2\n\nBase-Line Characteristics of the Patients.\nThe tidal volumes and plateau pressures were significantly lower on days 1, 3, and 7 in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes (Table 3). The mean (±SD) tidal volumes on days 1 to 3 were 6.2± 0.8 and 11.8±0.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight (P<0.001), respectively, and the mean plateau pressures were 25±6 and 33±8 cm of water (P<0.001), respectively. The partial pressure of arterial oxygen was similar in the two groups at all three times, but the positive end-expiratory pressure and fraction of inspired oxygen were significantly higher and the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen was significantly lower in the group treated with lower tidal volumes on days 1 and 3. On day 7, positive end-expiratory pressure and the fraction of inspired oxygen were significantly higher in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes. The respiratory rate was significantly higher in the group treated with lower tidal volumes on days 1 and 3, but minute ventilation was similar in the two groups on these days. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide was significantly higher on days 1, 3, and 7 and arterial pH was significantly lower on days 1 and 3 in the group treated with lower tidal volumes.\nTable 3\n\nRespiratory Values during the First Seven Days of Treatment in Patients with Acute Lung Injury and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.\nThe probability of survival and of being discharged home and breathing without assistance during the first 180 days after randomization is shown in Figure 1. The mortality rate was 39.8 percent in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes and 31.0 percent in the group\n######################\nOutput:"

Methods to enhance the quality of measurements included holding biannual meetings of investigators, sending newsletters, and conducting random quality-assurance evaluations.\nStatistical Analysis\nA sample size of 800 patients (400 per group) was needed to achieve a statistical power of 80% to detect an absolute decrease in mortality of 10% from an existing death rate of 50% in patients who did not have a response to corticotropin (40% of the total group). All analyses were performed according to a prespecified plan. The population was analyzed according to an intention-to-treat principle. The rate of death from all causes at 28 days was analyzed with the use of Fisher's exact test for differences between study groups. A maximum overall two-sided probability of a type I error of 5% was accepted. The test result was corrected for two interim analyses for efficacy. Splitting the alpha error function was performed according to the O'Brien–Fleming method (P=0.0006, P=0.005, and P=0.047 for the first, second, and final analysis, respectively).\nThe difference in the rate of death at 28 days between the two study groups was considered to have statistical significance if the stopping criteria of the interim analysis were met or the two-sided P value of the final analysis was less than 0.047. The differences between all other secondary efficacy variables were assumed to have statistical significance for P values of less than 0.05. Kaplan–Meier curves for cumulative survival during the 28-day observation period were constructed and compared with the use of the log-rank test. The median time until the reversal of septic shock was calculated with the use of Kaplan–Meier analysis. Adverse events were reported for the per-protocol population.\nResults\nPatients\nFive hundred patients were enrolled in the study (Figure 1). One patient in the hydrocortisone group was excluded because consent was withdrawn. Of the remaining 499 patients, all met the entry criteria, although 15 also fulfilled the exclusion criteria (8 patients in the hydrocortisone group and 7 in the placebo group) since 14 had received previous corticosteroid therapy and 1 had undergone previous cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Eighty-seven percent of patients in both the hydrocortisone group and the placebo group received at least 90% of the doses of a study drug.\nFigure 1\n\nEnrollment and Outcomes.\nOf 499 patients in the study, 233 (46.7%) did not have a response to corticotropin (125 in the hydrocortisone group and 108 in the placebo group); 254 patients (50.9%) did have a response to corticotropin (118 in the hydrocortisone group and 136 in the placebo group). Results were unknown for eight patients in the hydrocortisone group and four in the placebo group (2.4%). Etomidate was used in 51 of 251 patients in the hydrocortisone group (20.3%) and in 45 of 248 patients in the placebo group (18.1%) before study entry and in 22 patients (8.8%) and 20 patients (8.1%), respectively, after study enrollment. Among the 96 patients who had received etomidate, 58 did not have a response to corticotropin (60.4%), as compared with 175 of 403 who did not receive etomidate (43.4%, P=0.004). The median time between the last dose of etomidate and enrollment was 14 hours (range, 1 to 67).\nAt baseline, the two study groups were well balanced with regard to demographic characteristics (Table 1), clinical characteristics (Table 2), and the type and site of infection and infecting organisms (Table 2 of the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 1\n\nDemographic Characteristics of the Patients, According to Subgroup.\nTable 2\n\nClinical Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline, According to Subgroup.\nPrimary End Points\nMortality\nThere was no significant difference between the two study groups in the primary outcome, the rate of death at 28 days among patients who did not have a response to corticotropin. There were 49 deaths in 125 patients in the hydrocortisone group (39.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 30.5 to 47.9) and 39 deaths in 108 patients in the placebo group (36.1%; 95% CI, 26.9 to 45.3; P=0.69). Likewise, there was no significant difference in the rate of death at 28 days in patients who had a response to corticotropin. There were 34 deaths in 118 patients in the hydrocortisone group (28.8%; 95% CI, 20.6 to 37.0) and 39 deaths among 136 patients in the placebo group (28.7%; 95% CI, 21.1 to 36.3; P=1.00). Overall, there were 86 deaths in the hydrocortisone group (34.3%; 95% CI, 28.3 to 40.2) and 78 deaths in the placebo group (\n######################\nOutput:"

(For details, see Table 1 of the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org.) Inclusion criteria were clinical evidence of infection, evidence of a systemic response to infection, and the onset of shock within the previous 72 hours (as defined by a systolic blood pressure of <90 mm Hg despite adequate fluid replacement or a need for vasopressors for at least 1 hour) and hypoperfusion or organ dysfunction attributable to sepsis. Notable exclusion criteria included underlying disease with a poor prognosis, a life expectancy of less than 24 hours, immunosuppression, and treatment with long-term corticosteroids within the past 6 months or short-term corticosteroids within the past 4 weeks.\nRandomization\nRandomization (in a 1:1 ratio) was stratified according to study center in blocks of four with the use of a computerized random-number generator list provided by a statistician who was not involved in the determination of eligibility, administration of a study drug, or an assessment of outcomes. In each center, the study drug (hydrocortisone or placebo) was sealed in sequentially numbered, identical boxes that contained the entire treatment for each patient to be administered sequentially. The sequence was concealed from the investigators. All patients, medical and nursing staff members, pharmacists, investigators, and members of the monitoring board remained unaware of study-group assignments throughout the study period.\nStudy Drugs\nHydrocortisone (Rotexmedica) was prepared in vials containing 100 mg of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder with ampules containing 2 ml of sterile water diluent; the vials were then coded and masked centrally (Klocke Verpackungs Service). Vials containing placebo were identical to those containing hydrocortisone. The study drugs were administered as a 50-mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours for 5 days, then tapered to 50 mg intravenously every 12 hours for days 6 to 8, 50 mg every 24 hours for days 9 to 11, and then stopped. A total of 29 doses were given. Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of patients were encouraged.24\nDefinitions\nOrgan-system failure was defined for each of the six major organ systems as a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 3 or 4 points (on a scale ranging from 0 to 4 for each organ system, for an aggregate score of 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction).25 Reversal of shock was defined as the maintenance of a systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg without vasopressor support for at least 24 hours. Superinfection was defined as a new infection occurring 48 hours or more after the initiation of a study drug.26 New sepsis was defined as a new septic episode with or without microbiologic confirmation. New septic shock was defined as a new episode of septic shock after reversal of the initial episode. The absence of a response to a corticotropin test was defined as an increase in the cortisol level of no more than 9 μg per deciliter (248 nmol per liter). 16\nData Collection\nClinical Evaluation\nThe following data were recorded: general characteristics of the patients, including demographic data, diagnoses, and recent surgery; the severity of illness, as assessed by vital signs, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II (on a scale from 0 to 163, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction),27 and the SOFA score25; and interventions, including the type and doses of vasopressors, antibiotics, and adjunctive treatments such as corticosteroids and etomidate.\nLaboratory Measures\nHematologic and chemical data, blood gas analyses, and cultures of blood and other specimens that were obtained from potential sites of infection were recorded. A short corticotropin test was performed with the use of blood samples taken immediately before and 60 minutes after an intravenous bolus of 0.25 mg of cosyntropin (Novartis or Alliance). After centrifugation, serum samples were stored at a temperature no higher than −20°C until assayed. To reduce heterogeneity in the determination of cortisol levels, all samples were measured blindly and serially before interim and final analyses in a central laboratory with the use of the Elecsys cortisol assay (Roche Diagnostics).\nFollow-up\nDuring the 28-day period after randomization, data were collected regarding vital signs, results from laboratory tests and cultures of specimens drawn from any new site of infection, and any major interventions that were performed. Rates of death at 28 days, in the ICU, in the hospital, and at 1 year after randomization were recorded.\nEnd Points\nThe primary end point was the rate of death at 28 days in patients who did not have a response to corticotropin. Secondary end points were the rates of death at 28 days in patients who had a response to corticotropin and in all patients, the rates of death in the ICU and in the hospital, the rates of death at 1 year after randomization, a reversal of organ system failure (including shock), and the duration of the stay in the ICU and the hospital.\nSafety was assessed by recording adverse events, particularly superinfection, gastrointestinal bleeding, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, clinical muscular weakness, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and peripheral ischemia.

There is a continuing controversy about whether one agent is superior to the other.\nMethods\nIn this multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned patients with shock to receive either dopamine or norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor therapy to restore and maintain blood pressure. When blood pressure could not be maintained with a dose of 20 μg per kilogram of body weight per minute for dopamine or a dose of 0.19 μg per kilogram per minute for norepinephrine, open-label norepinephrine, epinephrine, or vasopressin could be added. The primary outcome was the rate of death at 28 days after randomization; secondary end points included the number of days without need for organ support and the occurrence of adverse events.\nResults\nThe trial included 1679 patients, of whom 858 were assigned to dopamine and 821 to norepinephrine. The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of death at 28 days (52.5% in the dopamine group and 48.5% in the norepinephrine group; odds ratio with dopamine, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.42; P=0.10). However, there were more arrhythmic events among the patients treated with dopamine than among those treated with norepinephrine (207 events [24.1%] vs. 102 events [12.4%], P<0.001). A subgroup analysis showed that dopamine, as compared with norepinephrine, was associated with an increased rate of death at 28 days among the 280 patients with cardiogenic shock but not among the 1044 patients with septic shock or the 263 with hypovolemic shock (P=0.03 for cardiogenic shock, P=0.19 for septic shock, and P=0.84 for hypovolemic shock, in Kaplan–Meier analyses).\nConclusions\nAlthough there was no significant difference in the rate of death between patients with shock who were treated with dopamine as the first-line vasopressor agent and those who were treated with norepinephrine, the use of dopamine was associated with a greater number of adverse events. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00314704.)\nCirculatory shock is a life-threatening condition that is associated with high mortality.1,2 The administration of fluids, which is the first-line therapeutic strategy, is often insufficient to stabilize the patient's condition, and adrenergic agents are frequently required to correct hypotension. Among these agents, dopamine and norepinephrine are used most frequently.3 Both of these agents influence alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors, but to different degrees. Alpha-adrenergic effects increase vascular tone but may decrease cardiac output and regional blood flow, especially in cutaneous, splanchnic, and renal beds. Beta-adrenergic effects help to maintain blood flow through inotropic and chronotropic effects and to increase splanchnic perfusion. This beta-adrenergic stimulation can have unwanted consequences as well, including increased cellular metabolism and immunosuppressive effects. Dopamine also stimulates dopaminergic receptors, resulting in a proportionately greater increase in splanchnic and renal perfusion, and it may facilitate resolution of lung edema.4 However, dopaminergic stimulation can have harmful immunologic effects by altering hypothalamo–pituitary function, resulting in a marked decrease in prolactin and growth hormone levels. 5\nThus, dopamine and norepinephrine may have different effects on the kidney, the splanchnic region, and the pituitary axis, but the clinical implications of these differences are still uncertain. Consensus guidelines and expert recommendations suggest that either agent may be used as a first-choice vasopressor in patients with shock.6–8 However, observational studies have shown that the administration of dopamine may be associated with rates of death that are higher than those associated with the administration of norepinephrine.3,9,10 The Sepsis Occurrence in Acutely Ill Patients (SOAP) study,3 which involved 1058 patients who were in shock, showed that administration of dopamine was an independent risk factor for death in the intensive care unit (ICU). In a meta-analysis,11 only three randomized studies, with a total of just 62 patients, were identified that compared the effects of dopamine and norepinephrine in patients with septic shock. The lack of data from clinical trials in the face of growing observational evidence that norepinephrine may be associated with better outcomes called for a randomized, controlled trial. Our study was designed to evaluate whether the choice of norepinephrine over dopamine as the first-line vasopressor agent could reduce the rate of death among patients in shock.\nMethods\nStudy Patients\nWe conducted this multicenter trial between December 19, 2003, and October 6, 2007, in eight centers in Belgium, Austria, and Spain. All patients 18 years of age or older in whom a vasopressor agent was required for the treatment of shock were included in the study. The patient was considered to be in shock if the mean arterial pressure was less than 70 mm Hg or the systolic blood pressure was less than 100 mm Hg despite the fact that an adequate amount of fluids (at least 1000 ml of crystalloids or 500 ml of colloids) had been administered (unless there was an elevation in the central venous pressure to >\n######################\nOutput:"

For the 357 patients with cultured pathogens for their primary infection, the clinical evaluation committee determined that appropriate antimicrobial therapy was given to 126 of 173 in the hydrocortisone group (72.8%) and 145 of 184 in the placebo group (78.8%). There was no significant difference in outcome between study groups among patients receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy and those receiving inappropriate therapy.\nUse of Corticosteroids and Other Drugs\nEleven patients in the hydrocortisone group (4.4%) and 10 patients in the placebo group (4.0%) received corticosteroids after study enrollment for allergic reactions, laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, brain edema, replacement of long-term corticosteroid therapy whose history was unknown at enrollment, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and septic shock. Five patients received corticosteroids for septic shock after completion of the course of a study drug. The numbers of patients in both groups who received activated protein C, antithrombin, or both were similar (Table 2).\nAdverse Events\nIn the hydrocortisone group, there was an increased incidence of superinfections, including new episodes of sepsis or septic shock, with a combined odds ratio of 1.37 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.79); there was also an increased incidence of hyperglycemia and hypernatremia (Table 4). Neuromuscular weakness was rarely reported.\nTable 4\n\nAdverse Events (Per-Protocol Population).\nDiscussion\nIn our study, the use of low-dose hydrocortisone had no significant effect on the rate of death in patients with septic shock at 28 days, regardless of the patients' adrenal responsiveness to corticotropin. The proportion of patients in whom reversal of shock was achieved was similar in the two groups, though this goal was achieved earlier in patients who received hydrocortisone.\nThese results are in marked contrast to those of the study by Annane et al.,16 in which both improved survival and reversal of shock were reported in patients with no response to corticotropin who received hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone. Differences between the two studies may stem from several factors. First, the studies involved dissimilar populations of patients. In the Annane study, the patients had higher SAPS II scores at baseline, and the entry requirement for systolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg for more than 1 hour despite fluid and vasopressor therapy; there also was a much higher rate of death at 28 days in the placebo group (61%, as compared with 32% in our study). Second, enrollment in the Annane study was allowed only within 8 hours after fulfilling entry criteria, as compared with a 72-hour window in our study. Third, fludrocortisone was not given to patients in our study, since 200 mg of hydrocortisone should provide adequate mineralocorticoid activity.28 Furthermore, absorption of oral fludrocortisone is variable in the shock state. Although an analysis of patients in our study who had a systolic blood pressure that persisted below 90 mm Hg at 1 day after fluid and vasopressor resuscitation showed a rate of death of 56.1% in the placebo group and an absolute reduction in mortality of 11.2% in the hydrocortisone group (results that are similar to those reported by Annane et al.), the subgroups of patients who received a study drug within 12 hours after baseline did not show any significant differences in outcome.\nAs reported previously,14,15,18 our study showed a decrease in the time to reversal of shock in the hydrocortisone group. However, the total number of patients who underwent reversal of shock was unaffected. It remains unclear why vascular tone improves in some patients but not in others. In an unexpected finding, the earlier rate of reversal of shock was greater in patients who had had a response to corticotropin but was not associated either with survival benefit or a reduction in duration of stay in either the ICU or the hospital. These findings may be unrelated to adrenal insufficiency but could instead result from a direct interaction with mechanisms producing vascular hyporeactivity.29,30 Alternatively, the effect may be due to a more widespread antiinflammatory action of corticosteroids, which inhibit the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, mediators, and receptors.31\nThe duration of the administration of corticosteroids may be pertinent, with the possibility that any gain that was achieved by an earlier reversal of shock was counterbalanced by later complications.9 In the Annane study, corticosteroid treatment was stopped abruptly after 7 days, whereas in our study, therapy was tapered from day 5 to day 11. Tapering was used because of the increase in proinflammatory mediators and hemodynamic deterioration after abrupt cessation of corticosteroids.17 Our study showed an increased incidence of superinfection, including new episodes of sepsis or septic shock, in the hydrocortisone group. Previous studies with high-dose corticosteroids have shown similar findings,11 whereas the study conducted by the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n######################\nOutput:"

This period may have contributed to the selection of patients with more severe ARDS19 who could benefit from the advantages of the prone positioning, such as relief of severe hypoxemia and prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury. A previous study has shown that prone positioning, as compared with supine positioning, markedly reduces the overinflated lung areas while promoting alveolar recruitment.5 These effects (reduction in overdistention and recruitment enhancement) may help prevent ventilator-induced lung injury by homogenizing the distribution of stress and strain within the lungs. In our trial, alveolar recruitment was not directly assessed. However, studies have shown that lung recruitability correlates with the extent of hypoxemia20,21 and that the transpulmonary pressure along the ventral-to-dorsal axis is more homogeneously distributed in the prone position than in the supine position.22 We therefore suggest that prone positioning in our patients induced a decrease in lung stress and strain.\nThird, as in previous investigations,9,10 we used long prone-positioning sessions. Fourth, the prone position was applied for 73% of the time ascribed to the intervention and was concentrated over a period of a few days. Fifth, in our trial, the tidal volume was lower than in previous trials,9,10 and the PplatRS was kept below 30 cm of water. However, because all patients were returned to the supine position at least once a day, the effect of the prone position itself cannot be distinguished from the effects of being moved from the supine to the prone position over the course of a day.\nWe should acknowledge that the technical aspects of prone positioning are not simple and that a coordinated team effort is required (see Videos 1 and 2, available at NEJM.org). All centers participating in this study were skilled in the process of turning patients from the supine to the prone position, as shown by the absence of adverse events directly related to repositioning. Because the experience of the units may explain the low rate of complications, our results cannot necessarily be generalized to centers without such experience. We should also emphasize that our results were obtained in the subgroup of severely ill patients with ARDS.\nIt could be argued that our results can be explained by higher mortality in the control group. However, mortality at day 28 in the supine group was similar to that among controls in recent trials.23,24 Furthermore, although the mortality in the control group was lower than that used to compute the power of this study, we calculated that the power of our study was 99%.\nThe study has several limitations. Although we planned to record the data of patients who were eligible but not included, only a few ICUs complied with this request, making it impossible to fully appreciate the physiological condition of the excluded patients. In addition, fluid balance and the cumulative dose of catecholamines were not assessed. The imbalance between the groups in baseline SOFA score, vasopressor use, and the use of neuromuscular blockers could also have influenced the results. However, even after adjustment for these covariates, mortality was significantly lower in the prone group.\nIn conclusion, this trial showed that patients with ARDS and severe hypoxemia (as confirmed by a PaO2:FiO2 ratio of <150 mm Hg, with an FiO2 of ≥0.6 and a PEEP of ≥5 cm of water) can benefit from prone treatment when it is used early and in relatively long sessions.\n######################\nOutput:"

Data analysis for serious adverse events was performed for all patients on an intention-to-treat basis.\nStudy Outcomes\nThe primary outcome was death from any cause by 28 days after inclusion. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, days alive and free from organ dysfunction by day 28, and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital. Survival by day 28 without organ support was defined as the number of days without catecholamine infusion, mechanical ventilation, or renal-replacement therapy.14 Serious adverse events were recorded and classified as cardiac, ischemic, or other.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe determined that the enrollment of 800 patients would provide a power of 80% to show an absolute between-group difference of 10 percentage points in the primary outcome, at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, assuming a rate of death of 45%. We decided not to compensate for dropouts caused by the withdrawal of consent. All analyses were performed by the study statistician before the randomization code was broken, in line with both the International Conference on Harmonization–Good Clinical Practice guidelines and our statistical analysis plan (which is available in the protocol).\nThe analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population, which was defined as all patients who had undergone randomization except for those who did not provide consent for the use of their data. We used Cox regression models to calculate between-group differences in mortality at 28 days and 90 days. We analyzed Schoenfeld residuals to test the assumption of proportional hazards and used the Kaplan–Meier method to calculate survival curves. We expressed quantitative variables as means (±SD) and used t-tests to compare them when the sample size in each group was 30 or more (in accordance with the central limit theorem) and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test when the sample size in one group was less than 30. We used chi-square tests or Fisher's exact test to compare qualitative variables, as appropriate. All comparisons were also performed with the use of the entire sample with stratification (as prespecified) according to the presence or absence of chronic hypertension. Multiple logistic-regression analyses were conducted in the intention-to-treat population to adjust for known risk factors for acute kidney injury, such as chronic renal failure or the use of diuretics, vancomycin, aminoglycosides, iodine-containing contrast material, or long-term use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.\nInterim analyses were performed for the primary outcome of 28-day mortality, according to the Haybittle–Peto method. Statistical significance was indicated by a P value of 0.001 in the three interim analyses and a two-sided P value of 0.0492 in the final analysis. To detect a possible interaction between group and stratum covariates, logistic-regression analyses were performed for dichotomous dependent variables, whereas analysis-of-variance models were used for continuous dependent variables. All analyses were performed with the use of Stata software, version 12.1.\nResults\nStudy Population\nWe enrolled 776 patients and followed them for 90 days; we conducted the analyses according to the group to which the patients were randomly assigned (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Table S1 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Overall, 167 of 388 patients (43.0%) in the high-target group and 173 of 388 (44.6%) in the low-target group had a history of chronic hypertension. All the enrolled patients were critically ill, as defined by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, serum lactate levels, and norepinephrine infusion rates at study entry. During the 5 protocol-specified days, the mean arterial pressures in the low-target group were significantly lower than those in the high-target group, yet they exceeded the target values of 65 to 70 mm Hg (Figure 2).\nFigure 1\n\nScreening, Randomization, and Follow-up of Study Patients.\nFigure 2\n\nMean Arterial Pressure during the 5-Day Study Period.\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\nVasopressor Use and Fluid Balance\nThe infusion rates of vasopressors were significantly higher, and the duration of vasopressor treatment significantly longer, in the high-target group than in the low-target group (Table 2, and Table S2A in the Supplementary Appendix). A total of 64 patients (16.5%) in the high-target group and 40 patients (10.3%) in the low-target group (P=0.01) did not reach targets for mean arterial pressure because of the attending physician's decision to limit the vasopressor infusion rates. In 14 patients (3.6%) in the high-target group, vasopressor infusion rates were adjusted downward to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 to 70 mm Hg because of adverse effects. Values for total fluid administration and total urine output during the 5 days specified in the protocol were similar in the two study groups (Table S2B in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 2\n\nClinical Results, Primary and Secondary Outcomes, and Serious Adverse Events.\nPrimary Outcome\nAt 28 days, there was no significant between-group difference in the rate\n######################\nOutput:"

Data analysis for serious adverse events was performed for all patients on an intention-to-treat basis.\nStudy Outcomes\nThe primary outcome was death from any cause by 28 days after inclusion. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, days alive and free from organ dysfunction by day 28, and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital. Survival by day 28 without organ support was defined as the number of days without catecholamine infusion, mechanical ventilation, or renal-replacement therapy.14 Serious adverse events were recorded and classified as cardiac, ischemic, or other.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe determined that the enrollment of 800 patients would provide a power of 80% to show an absolute between-group difference of 10 percentage points in the primary outcome, at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, assuming a rate of death of 45%. We decided not to compensate for dropouts caused by the withdrawal of consent. All analyses were performed by the study statistician before the randomization code was broken, in line with both the International Conference on Harmonization–Good Clinical Practice guidelines and our statistical analysis plan (which is available in the protocol).\nThe analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population, which was defined as all patients who had undergone randomization except for those who did not provide consent for the use of their data.

At 28 days, the primary outcome was death among patients who did not have a response to a corticotropin test.\nResults\nOf the 499 patients in the study, 233 (46.7%) did not have a response to corticotropin (125 in the hydrocortisone group and 108 in the placebo group). At 28 days, there was no significant difference in mortality between patients in the two study groups who did not have a response to corticotropin (39.2% in the hydrocortisone group and 36.1% in the placebo group, P=0.69) or between those who had a response to corticotropin (28.8% in the hydrocortisone group and 28.7% in the placebo group, P=1.00). At 28 days, 86 of 251 patients in the hydrocortisone group (34.3%) and 78 of 248 patients in the placebo group (31.5%) had died (P=0.51). In the hydrocortisone group, shock was reversed more quickly than in the placebo group. However, there were more episodes of superinfection, including new sepsis and septic shock.\nConclusions\nHydrocortisone did not improve survival or reversal of shock in patients with septic shock, either overall or in patients who did not have a response to corticotropin, although hydrocortisone hastened reversal of shock in patients in whom shock was reversed. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00147004.)\nSevere sepsis is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide.1,2 Septic shock, the most severe manifestation, occurs in 2 to 20% of inpatients.3 The incidence of the condition has been rising,4 and a death rate of 33 to 61% has been reported in the placebo groups of multicenter trials.5–8\nThe use of corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy has been controversial for decades.9 After the study by Schumer,10 a short course of high-dose corticosteroids became accepted therapy. Subsequent studies, however, did not confirm a survival benefit with this regimen and suggested an increase in superinfection-related mortality.11–13 Studies that have used lower doses of hydrocortisone (200 to 300 mg per day) for longer durations have reported earlier reversal of shock14–18 and improved survival.14,16 The prognostic importance of the response to corticotropin had been recognized in critical illness previously,19,20 and the results in the hydrocortisone studies were particularly apparent in patients who did not have a response to a corticotropin test. Meta-analyses,21,22 reviews,20 and guidelines23 have advocated the use of low-dose hydrocortisone in patients with septic shock. These recommendations were based primarily on a study of patients with septic shock who remained hypotensive after at least 1 hour of resuscitation with fluids and vasopressors.16 In this study, a survival benefit was seen in patients with no response to corticotropin who received hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Our trial, called the Corticosteroid Therapy of Septic Shock (CORTICUS) study, evaluated the efficacy and safety of low-dose hydrocortisone therapy in a broad population of patients with septic shock — in particular, patients who had had a response to a corticotropin test, in whom a benefit was unproven.9\nMethods\nStudy Design\nIn this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the protocol was approved by the ethics committee at each of the 52 participating intensive care units (ICUs). Patients were enrolled from March 2002 to November 2005, after providing written informed consent. In cases in which a patient lacked mental competency, consent was obtained either from a surrogate, the next of kin, or a legal representative (with retrospective consent obtained from patients who regained competency), according to national regulations.

        "text": "Abstract\nBackground\nHydrocortisone is widely used in patients with septic shock even though a survival benefit has been reported only in patients who remained hypotensive after fluid and vasopressor resuscitation and whose plasma cortisol levels did not rise appropriately after the administration of corticotropin.\nMethods\nIn this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned 251 patients to receive 50 mg of intravenous hydrocortisone and 248 patients to receive placebo every 6 hours for 5 days; the dose was then tapered during a 6-day period. At 28 days, the primary outcome was death among patients who did not have a response to a corticotropin test.\nResults\nOf the 499 patients in the study, 233 (46.7%) did not have a response to corticotropin (125 in the hydrocortisone group and 108 in the placebo group). At 28 days, there was no significant difference in mortality between patients in the two study groups who did not have a response to corticotropin (39.2% in the hydrocortisone group and 36.1% in the placebo group, P=0.69) or between those who had a response to corticotropin (28.8% in the hydrocortisone group and 28.7% in the placebo group, P=1.00). At 28 days, 86 of 251 patients in the hydrocortisone group (34.3%) and 78 of 248 patients in the placebo group (31.5%) had died (P=0.51). In the hydrocortisone group, shock was reversed more quickly than in the placebo group. However, there were more episodes of superinfection, including new sepsis and septic shock.\nConclusions\nHydrocortisone did not improve survival or reversal of shock in patients with septic shock, either overall or in patients who did not have a response to corticotropin, although hydrocortisone hastened reversal of shock in patients in whom shock was reversed. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00147004.)\nSevere sepsis is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide.1,2 Septic shock, the most severe manifestation, occurs in 2 to 20% of inpatients.3 The incidence of the condition has been rising,4 and a death rate of 33 to 61% has been reported in the placebo groups of multicenter trials.5–8\nThe use of corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy has been controversial for decades.9 After the study by Schumer,10 a short course of high-dose corticosteroids became accepted therapy. Subsequent studies, however, did not confirm a survival benefit with this regimen and suggested an increase in superinfection-related mortality.11–13 Studies that have used lower doses of hydrocortisone (200 to 300 mg per day) for longer durations have reported earlier reversal of shock14–18 and improved survival.14,16 The prognostic importance of the response to corticotropin had been recognized in critical illness previously,19,20 and the results in the hydrocortisone studies were particularly apparent in patients who did not have a response to a corticotropin test. Meta-analyses,21,22 reviews,20 and guidelines23 have advocated the use of low-dose hydrocortisone in patients with septic shock. These recommendations were based primarily on a study of patients with septic shock who remained hypotensive after at least 1 hour of resuscitation with fluids and vasopressors.16 In this study, a survival benefit was seen in patients with no response to corticotropin who received hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Our trial, called the Corticosteroid Therapy of Septic Shock (CORTICUS) study, evaluated the efficacy and safety of low-dose hydrocortisone therapy in a broad population of patients with septic shock — in particular, patients who had had a response to a corticotropin test, in whom a benefit was unproven.9\nMethods\nStudy Design\nIn this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the protocol was approved by the ethics committee at each of the 52 participating intensive care units (ICUs). Patients were enrolled from March 2002 to November 2005, after providing written informed consent. In cases in which a patient lacked mental competency, consent was obtained either from a surrogate, the next of kin, or a legal representative (with retrospective consent obtained from patients who regained competency), according to national regulations. An independent data and safety monitoring board met after each of three interim analyses. At the end of the study, a clinical evaluation committee whose members were unaware of study-group assignments assessed the appropriateness of antiinfective treatments.\nThe authors designed the study, gathered and analyzed the data, and vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and the analysis. The sponsors had no role in the design and conduct of the study, in the collection, management, analysis, or interpretation of the data, or in the preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript.\nPatients\nPatients who were 18 years of age or older and had been hospitalized in participating ICUs were prospectively enrolled in the study if they met all eligibility criteria.

Assuming that severe sepsis and septic shock reflect a disease continuum, it was hypothesized that early hydrocortisone administration might prevent shock development owing to the attenuation of an exaggerated inflammatory response. To our knowledge, this is the first RCT investigating the effects of hydrocortisone to prevent progression to shock in patients with severe sepsis presenting without shock.\n\nMethods\nStudy Design\nThe Hydrocortisone for Prevention of Septic Shock (HYPRESS) study is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind RCT supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The study was conducted in cooperation with the German Sepsis Competence Network (SepNet) and the Clinical Trial Centre Leipzig, which provided internet-based randomization and data capture, assurance of accuracy and completeness of data, biostatistical analysis, and pharmacovigilance. Monitoring of sites was performed on defined intervals. The protocol was approved by the responsible ethics committees of all 34 participating sites. The trial protocol is available in Supplement 2.\n\nStudy Patients\nPatients were screened in intermediate care units or intensive care units (ICUs) of university and community hospitals for eligibility, and written informed consent was obtained from patients, patient-authorized representatives, or legal representatives. Patients were enrolled if they met all inclusion criteria (for details, see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1): (1) provided informed consent; (2) had evidence of infection; (3) had evidence of a systemic response to infection, defined as at least 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria12; and (4) had evidence of organ dysfunction present for not longer than 48 hours. The main exclusion criterion was septic shock. Other exclusion criteria were being younger than 18 years, having known hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or mannitol (placebo), or having a history of glucocorticoid medication with indication for continuation of therapy or other indications for treatment with glucocorticoids. Patients were not excluded for using etomidate within 72 hours before enrollment, using a short course of glucocorticoids within 72 hours before enrollment, or using topical or inhaled glucocorticoids.\n\nDefinitions\nSeptic shock was defined as sepsis-induced hypotension despite adequate volume status for longer than 4 hours (ie, mean arterial pressure <65 mm Hg, systolic arterial pressure <90 mm Hg, or the use of vasopressors to keep mean arterial pressure ≥65 mm Hg or systolic arterial pressure ≥90 mm Hg). Patients who had a transient need for vasopressors during initial resuscitation but were not hypotensive and did not use vasopressors for at least 2 hours were eligible for enrollment when septic shock was not present at the time of randomization. Adequate volume status was defined as a central venous pressure of 8 mm Hg or greater (≥12 mm Hg in ventilated patients) and a central venous oxygen saturation greater than 70%. For fluid replacement, patients were to receive at least 500 to 1000 mL of crystalloids or 300 to 500 mL of colloids over 30 minutes. The use of hydroxyethyl starch preparations was discouraged owing to possible harmful effects on kidney function.13,14 Use of vasopressors was defined as therapy with dopamine at a dosage of at least 5 µg/kg/min or with any dose of epinephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, or other vasopressors. For further details and definitions, see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1.\n\nRandomization\nRandomization was stratified by participating center and sex. It was performed with an internet-based computerized randomization tool that uses a modified version of the Pocock minimization algorithm15 with a random component to generate balanced 1:1 randomization in the strata at any time. All patients, study personnel, sponsors, medical staff, and nursing staff were blinded regarding the allocation of study medication throughout the entire study period.\n\nStudy Medication\nThe study medication (hydrocortisone and placebo) was produced and released by BAG Health Care GmbH. The medication was delivered in boxes, each containing 17 brown glass vials for 1 patient. Each vial contained 100 mg of lyophilized hydrocortisone hydrogen succinate or the same amount of lyophilized mannitol as placebo, which was indistinguishable from hydrocortisone. The medication was administered as an intravenous bolus of 50 mg, followed by a 24-hour continuous infusion of 200 mg on 5 days, 100 mg on days 6 and 7, 50 mg on days 8 and 9, and 25 mg on days 10 and 11. Hydrocortisone dose corresponded to those used in the 2 major RCTs performed earlier,3,4 which had shown significant effects on septic shock resolution. A continuous infusion was preferred to avoid possible undulation of the blood cortisol concentrations by bolus administration, which had been reported to complicate blood glucose control.16 A continuous infusion was also recommended in the recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines.2 To reduce possible hemodynamic and immunological rebound effects,17 hydrocortisone was tapered over several days as in the CORTICUS study.4 Study medication was discontinued for safety reasons or when patients were discharged from the ICU or reached the primary end point.\n\nEnd Points\n######################\nOutput:"

        "text": "5-7 In a smaller RCT in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hydrocortisone significantly improved survival and prevented progression to shock.8 Furthermore, 2 recent RCTs9,10 and a meta-analysis11 revealed positive effects of steroids in patients with CAP. Assuming that severe sepsis and septic shock reflect a disease continuum, it was hypothesized that early hydrocortisone administration might prevent shock development owing to the attenuation of an exaggerated inflammatory response. To our knowledge, this is the first RCT investigating the effects of hydrocortisone to prevent progression to shock in patients with severe sepsis presenting without shock.\n\nMethods\nStudy Design\nThe Hydrocortisone for Prevention of Septic Shock (HYPRESS) study is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind RCT supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The study was conducted in cooperation with the German Sepsis Competence Network (SepNet) and the Clinical Trial Centre Leipzig, which provided internet-based randomization and data capture, assurance of accuracy and completeness of data, biostatistical analysis, and pharmacovigilance. Monitoring of sites was performed on defined intervals. The protocol was approved by the responsible ethics committees of all 34 participating sites. The trial protocol is available in Supplement 2.\n\nStudy Patients\nPatients were screened in intermediate care units or intensive care units (ICUs) of university and community hospitals for eligibility, and written informed consent was obtained from patients, patient-authorized representatives, or legal representatives. Patients were enrolled if they met all inclusion criteria (for details, see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1): (1) provided informed consent; (2) had evidence of infection; (3) had evidence of a systemic response to infection, defined as at least 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria12; and (4) had evidence of organ dysfunction present for not longer than 48 hours. The main exclusion criterion was septic shock. Other exclusion criteria were being younger than 18 years, having known hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or mannitol (placebo), or having a history of glucocorticoid medication with indication for continuation of therapy or other indications for treatment with glucocorticoids. Patients were not excluded for using etomidate within 72 hours before enrollment, using a short course of glucocorticoids within 72 hours before enrollment, or using topical or inhaled glucocorticoids.\n\nDefinitions\nSeptic shock was defined as sepsis-induced hypotension despite adequate volume status for longer than 4 hours (ie, mean arterial pressure <65 mm Hg, systolic arterial pressure <90 mm Hg, or the use of vasopressors to keep mean arterial pressure ≥65 mm Hg or systolic arterial pressure ≥90 mm Hg). Patients who had a transient need for vasopressors during initial resuscitation but were not hypotensive and did not use vasopressors for at least 2 hours were eligible for enrollment when septic shock was not present at the time of randomization. Adequate volume status was defined as a central venous pressure of 8 mm Hg or greater (≥12 mm Hg in ventilated patients) and a central venous oxygen saturation greater than 70%. For fluid replacement, patients were to receive at least 500 to 1000 mL of crystalloids or 300 to 500 mL of colloids over 30 minutes. The use of hydroxyethyl starch preparations was discouraged owing to possible harmful effects on kidney function.13,14 Use of vasopressors was defined as therapy with dopamine at a dosage of at least 5 µg/kg/min or with any dose of epinephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, or other vasopressors. For further details and definitions, see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1.\n\nRandomization\nRandomization was stratified by participating center and sex. It was performed with an internet-based computerized randomization tool that uses a modified version of the Pocock minimization algorithm15 with a random component to generate balanced 1:1 randomization in the strata at any time. All patients, study personnel, sponsors, medical staff, and nursing staff were blinded regarding the allocation of study medication throughout the entire study period.\n\nStudy Medication\nThe study medication (hydrocortisone and placebo) was produced and released by BAG Health Care GmbH. The medication was delivered in boxes, each containing 17 brown glass vials for 1 patient. Each vial contained 100 mg of lyophilized hydrocortisone hydrogen succinate or the same amount of lyophilized mannitol as placebo, which was indistinguishable from hydrocortisone. The medication was administered as an intravenous bolus of 50 mg, followed by a 24-hour continuous infusion of 200 mg on 5 days, 100 mg on days 6 and 7, 50 mg on days 8 and 9, and 25 mg on days 10 and 11. Hydrocortisone dose corresponded to those used in the 2 major RCTs performed earlier,3,4 which had shown significant effects on septic shock resolution. A continuous infusion was preferred to avoid possible undulation of the blood cortisol concentrations by bolus administration, which had been reported to complicate blood glucose control.16 A continuous infusion was also recommended in the recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines.2 To reduce possible hemodynamic and immunological rebound effects,17 hydrocortisone was tapered over several days as in the CORTICUS study.4 Study medication was discontinued for safety reasons or when patients were discharged from the ICU or reached the primary end point.\n\nEnd Points"

The lung injury score was 3.3±0.4 in both groups, and the rate of use of noninvasive ventilation in the 24 hours before inclusion was similar in the two groups (29.3% and 30.8% in the supine and prone groups, respectively). Ventilator settings, respiratory-system mechanics, and results of arterial blood-gas measurements were also similar in the two groups (Table 2).\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Participants at Inclusion in the Study.\nTable 2\n\nVentilator Settings, Respiratory-System Mechanics, and Results of Arterial Blood Gas Measurements at the Time of Inclusion in the Study.\nProne Positioning\nPatients in the prone group underwent their first prone-positioning session within 55±55 minutes after randomization. The average number of sessions was 4±4 per patient, and the mean duration per session was 17±3 hours. All the patients in this group underwent at least one prone-positioning session. In the prone group, patients were ventilated in the prone position for 73% of the 22,334 patient-hours spent in the ICU from the start of the first session to the end of the last session.\nAdjunctive Therapies\nThe rates of the use of rescue therapies in the supine and prone groups were 2.6% versus 0.8% for ECMO (P=0.14), 15.7% versus 9.7% for inhaled nitric oxide (P=0.05), and 6.6% versus 2.5% for almitrine bismesylate (P=0.04). Neuromuscular blockers were used for 5.6±5.0 days in the supine group and 5.7±4.7 days in the prone group (P=0.74), and intravenous sedation was given for 9.5±6.8 and 10.1±7.2 days in the two groups, respectively (P=0.35). The use of antiviral therapy for H1N1 virus infection was similar in the two groups.\nVentilator Settings and Lung Function during the First Week\nThe PaO2:FiO2 ratio recorded in the supine position was significantly higher in the prone group than in the supine group at days 3 and 5, whereas the PEEP and FiO2 were significantly lower (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The PplatRS was 2 cm of water lower by day 3 in the prone group than in the supine group. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and static compliance of the respiratory system were similar in the two groups.\nPrimary and Secondary Outcomes\nMortality at day 28 was significantly lower in the prone group than in the supine group: 16.0% (38 of 237 participants) versus 32.8% (75 of 229) (P<0.001) (Table 3). The significant difference in mortality persisted at day 90 (Table 3). A comparison of the two survival curves showed the same significant difference (Figure 2). After adjustment for the SOFA score and the use of neuromuscular blockers and vasopressors at the time of inclusion, mortality remained significantly lower in the prone group than in the supine group (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The rate of successful extubation was significantly higher in the prone group (Table 3). The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the ICU, incidence of pneumothorax, rate of use of noninvasive ventilation after extubation, and tracheotomy rate did not differ significantly between the two groups (Table 3).\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan–Meier Plot of the Probability of Survival from Randomization to Day 90.\nTable 3\n\nPrimary and Secondary Outcomes According to Study Group.\nComplications\nA total of 31 cardiac arrests occurred in the supine group, and 16 in the prone group (P=0.02). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to other adverse effects (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nDiscussion\nSurvival after severe ARDS was significantly higher in the prone group than in the supine group. Furthermore, the effect size was large despite the fact that mortality in the supine group was lower than anticipated.\nOur results are consistent with findings from previous meta-analyses2,11 and an observational study,18 even though prior randomized trials have failed to show a survival benefit with prone positioning. Meta-analyses of ARDS studies have suggested that the outcomes with prone positioning are better in the subgroup of patients with severe hypoxemia.2,11 However, when we stratified our analysis according to quartile of PaO2:FiO2 ratio at enrollment, we found no significant differences in outcomes (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nSeveral factors may explain our results. First, patients with severe ARDS were selected on the basis of oxygenation together with PEEP and FiO2 levels. Second, patients were included after a 12-to-24-hour period during which the ARDS criteria were confirmed. This period may have contributed to the selection of patients with more severe ARDS19 who could benefit from the advantages of the prone positioning, such as relief of severe hypoxemia and prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury. A previous study has shown that prone positioning, as compared with supine positioning, markedly reduces the overinflated lung areas while promoting alveolar recruitment.5\n######################\nOutput:"

The lung injury score was 3.3±0.4 in both groups, and the rate of use of noninvasive ventilation in the 24 hours before inclusion was similar in the two groups (29.3% and 30.8% in the supine and prone groups, respectively). Ventilator settings, respiratory-system mechanics, and results of arterial blood-gas measurements were also similar in the two groups (Table 2).\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Participants at Inclusion in the Study.\nTable 2\n\nVentilator Settings, Respiratory-System Mechanics, and Results of Arterial Blood Gas Measurements at the Time of Inclusion in the Study.\nProne Positioning\nPatients in the prone group underwent their first prone-positioning session within 55±55 minutes after randomization. The average number of sessions was 4±4 per patient, and the mean duration per session was 17±3 hours. All the patients in this group underwent at least one prone-positioning session. In the prone group, patients were ventilated in the prone position for 73% of the 22,334 patient-hours spent in the ICU from the start of the first session to the end of the last session.\nAdjunctive Therapies\nThe rates of the use of rescue therapies in the supine and prone groups were 2.6% versus 0.8% for ECMO (P=0.14), 15.7% versus 9.7% for inhaled nitric oxide (P=0.05), and 6.6% versus 2.5% for almitrine bismesylate (P=0.04). Neuromuscular blockers were used for 5.6±5.0 days in the supine group and 5.7±4.7 days in the prone group (P=0.74), and intravenous sedation was given for 9.5±6.8 and 10.1±7.2 days in the two groups, respectively (P=0.35). The use of antiviral therapy for H1N1 virus infection was similar in the two groups.\nVentilator Settings and Lung Function during the First Week\nThe PaO2:FiO2 ratio recorded in the supine position was significantly higher in the prone group than in the supine group at days 3 and 5, whereas the PEEP and FiO2 were significantly lower (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The PplatRS was 2 cm of water lower by day 3 in the prone group than in the supine group. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and static compliance of the respiratory system were similar in the two groups.\nPrimary and Secondary Outcomes\nMortality at day 28 was significantly lower in the prone group than in the supine group: 16.0% (38 of 237 participants) versus 32.8% (75 of 229) (P<0.001) (Table 3). The significant difference in mortality persisted at day 90 (Table 3). A comparison of the two survival curves showed the same significant difference (Figure 2). After adjustment for the SOFA score and the use of neuromuscular blockers and vasopressors at the time of inclusion, mortality remained significantly lower in the prone group than in the supine group (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The rate of successful extubation was significantly higher in the prone group (Table 3). The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the ICU, incidence of pneumothorax, rate of use of noninvasive ventilation after extubation, and tracheotomy rate did not differ significantly between the two groups (Table 3).\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan–Meier Plot of the Probability of Survival from Randomization to Day 90.\nTable 3\n\nPrimary and Secondary Outcomes According to Study Group.\nComplications\nA total of 31 cardiac arrests occurred in the supine group, and 16 in the prone group (P=0.02). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to other adverse effects (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nDiscussion\nSurvival after severe ARDS was significantly higher in the prone group than in the supine group. Furthermore, the effect size was large despite the fact that mortality in the supine group was lower than anticipated.\nOur results are consistent with findings from previous meta-analyses2,11 and an observational study,18 even though prior randomized trials have failed to show a survival benefit with prone positioning. Meta-analyses of ARDS studies have suggested that the outcomes with prone positioning are better in the subgroup of patients with severe hypoxemia.2,11 However, when we stratified our analysis according to quartile of PaO2:FiO2 ratio at enrollment, we found no significant differences in outcomes (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nSeveral factors may explain our results. First, patients with severe ARDS were selected on the basis of oxygenation together with PEEP and FiO2 levels. Second, patients were included after a 12-to-24-hour period during which the ARDS criteria were confirmed. This period may have contributed to the selection of patients with more severe ARDS19 who could benefit from the advantages of the prone positioning, such as relief of severe hypoxemia and prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury. A previous study has shown that prone positioning, as compared with supine positioning, markedly reduces the overinflated lung areas while promoting alveolar recruitment.5"

Values for total fluid administration and total urine output during the 5 days specified in the protocol were similar in the two study groups (Table S2B in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 2\n\nClinical Results, Primary and Secondary Outcomes, and Serious Adverse Events.\nPrimary Outcome\nAt 28 days, there was no significant between-group difference in the rate of death, with deaths reported in 142 of 388 patients (36.6%) in the high-target group and 132 of 388 patients (34.0%) in the low-target group (hazard ratio in the high-target group, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.38; P=0.57). There was also no significant between-group difference in mortality at 90 days, with 170 deaths (43.7%) and 164 deaths (42.3%), in the two groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.30; P=0.74) (Table 2 and Figure 3).\nFigure 3\n\nKaplan–Meier Curves for Cumulative Survival.\nIn addition, there were no significant differences in the secondary outcomes: need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the ICU and hospital, and the SOFA score by day 7 (Table 2, and Tables S2C and S2D in the Supplementary Appendix). However, in patients with chronic arterial hypertension, there was a significant interaction between study group and hypertension stratum with respect to the doubling of the blood creatinine level (P=0.009) and with respect to the need for renal-replacement therapy (P=0.04). Multivariate logistic-regression analysis indicated that none of the potentially nephrotoxic therapies influenced this result.\nAdverse Events\nThere was no significant difference between the two study groups in the overall incidence of serious adverse events (P=0.64) (Table 2, and Table S2E in the Supplementary Appendix). Although the total number of cardiac adverse events did not differ between the groups, the incidence of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation was significantly higher in the high-target group, with events reported in 26 patients (6.7%) in the high-target group and 11 patients (2.8%) in the low-target group (P=0.02). The frequencies of ischemic events and bleeding complications were similar in the two study groups.\nDiscussion\nIn this multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, we compared the strategy of targeting a high mean arterial pressure (80 to 85 mm Hg) with the strategy of targeting a low pressure (65 to 70 mm Hg) in patients with septic shock. The high-target group received significantly higher doses of vasopressor catecholamines over a significantly longer time period, but we found no significant difference in 28-day mortality. There was no significant between-group difference in early fluid balance, and the fluid balance was lower than those reported previously,7,8 possibly because our population of patients differed from those in previous studies or because of more restrictive protocols for fluid administration in France. In addition, there were no significant between-group differences in the overall rates of organ dysfunction or death at 90 days. However, in patients with a history of chronic arterial hypertension, targeting a mean arterial pressure of 80 to 85 mm Hg reduced both the incidence of a doubling of the blood creatinine level and the rate of renal-replacement therapy. There was no significant between-group difference in the overall rate of serious adverse events, but patients in the high-target group had significantly more episodes of atrial fibrillation.\nNo differences in the primary and secondary outcomes were observed between the two groups. Our study was prospectively powered to detect an absolute difference of 10 percentage points in the rate of death on the basis of an expected rate of 45% in the low-target group, at an alpha level of 0.05 and a beta level of 0.20, with the use of a two-tailed test. The expected overall death rate in our study was consistent with the rates among patients with septic shock that were reported in previous multicenter trials (37%,5 39%,8 47%,4 and 49%6) at the time the trial was designed. The absolute reduction of 10 percentage points in mortality was chosen in our study because the trials that were available in the literature when the protocol was designed in 2008 had tested the hypothesis of absolute reductions of 20 percentage points,5 15 percentage points,4 and 10 percentage points8 in rates of death. Two other trials that were published after we started recruiting patients tested the hypothesis of an absolute mortality reduction of 7 percentage points7,15 and 10 percentage points.16 Hence, the anticipated risk reduction in our study was close to the risk reductions tested in previous studies. However, our observed rate of death at 28 days was lower than the rate in some other studies, although it was in line with the rate in more recent trials, in which death rates ranging from 25 to 57% were reported.7,15 Nevertheless, the lower-than-expected rate of death led to an underpowered study. Therefore, we may not have detected differences in the incidence of some adverse events, especially rare events such as myocardial infarction.\nSeptic shock is a major risk factor for atrial fibrillation,17 and in our study, atrial fibrillation was significantly more common in the high-target group than in the low-target group. This adverse effect might be related to the significantly higher doses of catecholamine and the longer duration of catech\n######################\nOutput:"

Values for total fluid administration and total urine output during the 5 days specified in the protocol were similar in the two study groups (Table S2B in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 2\n\nClinical Results, Primary and Secondary Outcomes, and Serious Adverse Events.\nPrimary Outcome\nAt 28 days, there was no significant between-group difference in the rate of death, with deaths reported in 142 of 388 patients (36.6%) in the high-target group and 132 of 388 patients (34.0%) in the low-target group (hazard ratio in the high-target group, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.38; P=0.57). There was also no significant between-group difference in mortality at 90 days, with 170 deaths (43.7%) and 164 deaths (42.3%), in the two groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.30; P=0.74) (Table 2 and Figure 3).\nFigure 3\n\nKaplan–Meier Curves for Cumulative Survival.\nIn addition, there were no significant differences in the secondary outcomes: need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the ICU and hospital, and the SOFA score by day 7 (Table 2, and Tables S2C and S2D in the Supplementary Appendix). However, in patients with chronic arterial hypertension, there was a significant interaction between study group and hypertension stratum with respect to the doubling of the blood creatinine level (P=0.009) and with respect to the need for renal-replacement therapy (P=0.04). Multivariate logistic-regression analysis indicated that none of the potentially nephrotoxic therapies influenced this result.\nAdverse Events\nThere was no significant difference between the two study groups in the overall incidence of serious adverse events (P=0.64) (Table 2, and Table S2E in the Supplementary Appendix). Although the total number of cardiac adverse events did not differ between the groups, the incidence of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation was significantly higher in the high-target group, with events reported in 26 patients (6.7%) in the high-target group and 11 patients (2.8%) in the low-target group (P=0.02). The frequencies of ischemic events and bleeding complications were similar in the two study groups.\nDiscussion\nIn this multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, we compared the strategy of targeting a high mean arterial pressure (80 to 85 mm Hg) with the strategy of targeting a low pressure (65 to 70 mm Hg) in patients with septic shock. The high-target group received significantly higher doses of vasopressor catecholamines over a significantly longer time period, but we found no significant difference in 28-day mortality. There was no significant between-group difference in early fluid balance, and the fluid balance was lower than those reported previously,7,8 possibly because our population of patients differed from those in previous studies or because of more restrictive protocols for fluid administration in France. In addition, there were no significant between-group differences in the overall rates of organ dysfunction or death at 90 days. However, in patients with a history of chronic arterial hypertension, targeting a mean arterial pressure of 80 to 85 mm Hg reduced both the incidence of a doubling of the blood creatinine level and the rate of renal-replacement therapy. There was no significant between-group difference in the overall rate of serious adverse events, but patients in the high-target group had significantly more episodes of atrial fibrillation.\nNo differences in the primary and secondary outcomes were observed between the two groups. Our study was prospectively powered to detect an absolute difference of 10 percentage points in the rate of death on the basis of an expected rate of 45% in the low-target group, at an alpha level of 0.05 and a beta level of 0.20, with the use of a two-tailed test. The expected overall death rate in our study was consistent with the rates among patients with septic shock that were reported in previous multicenter trials (37%,5 39%,8 47%,4 and 49%6) at the time the trial was designed. The absolute reduction of 10 percentage points in mortality was chosen in our study because the trials that were available in the literature when the protocol was designed in 2008 had tested the hypothesis of absolute reductions of 20 percentage points,5 15 percentage points,4 and 10 percentage points8 in rates of death. Two other trials that were published after we started recruiting patients tested the hypothesis of an absolute mortality reduction of 7 percentage points7,15 and 10 percentage points.16 Hence, the anticipated risk reduction in our study was close to the risk reductions tested in previous studies. However, our observed rate of death at 28 days was lower than the rate in some other studies, although it was in line with the rate in more recent trials, in which death rates ranging from 25 to 57% were reported.7,15 Nevertheless, the lower-than-expected rate of death led to an underpowered study. Therefore, we may not have detected differences in the incidence of some adverse events, especially rare events such as myocardial infarction.\nSeptic shock is a major risk factor for atrial fibrillation,17 and in our study, atrial fibrillation was significantly more common in the high-target group than in the low-target group. This adverse effect might be related to the significantly higher doses of catecholamine and the longer duration of catech"

Diuresis or fluid restriction may improve lung function but could jeopardize extrapulmonary-organ perfusion.\nMethods\nIn a randomized study, we compared a conservative and a liberal strategy of fluid management using explicit protocols applied for seven days in 1000 patients with acute lung injury. The primary end point was death at 60 days. Secondary end points included the number of ventilator-free days and organ-failure–free days and measures of lung physiology.\nResults\nThe rate of death at 60 days was 25.5 percent in the conservative-strategy group and 28.4 percent in the liberal-strategy group (P=0.30; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, −2.6 to 8.4 percent). The mean (±SE) cumulative fluid balance during the first seven days was –136±491 ml in the conservative-strategy group and 6992±502 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001). As compared with the liberal strategy, the conservative strategy improved the oxygenation index ([mean airway pressure×the ratio of the fraction of inspired oxygen to the partial pressure of arterial oxygen]×100) and the lung injury score and increased the number of ventilator-free days (14.6±0.5 vs. 12.1±0.5, P<0.001) and days not spent in the intensive care unit (13.4±0.4 vs. 11.2±0.4, P<0.001) during the first 28 days but did not increase the incidence or prevalence of shock during the study or the use of dialysis during the first 60 days (10 percent vs. 14 percent, P=0.06).\nConclusions\nAlthough there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of 60-day mortality, the conservative strategy of fluid management improved lung function and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care without increasing nonpulmonary-organ failures. These results support the use of a conservative strategy of fluid management in patients with acute lung injury. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00281268.)\nPulmonary edema resulting from increased capillary permeability, a hallmark of acute lung injury, worsens as intravascular hydrostatic pressure rises and oncotic pressure falls.1,2 Although lung failure alone can be lethal, death in patients with acute lung injury is usually due to the failure of nonpulmonary organs.1,3\nThe optimal fluid management of acute lung injury is not settled.4–7 The usual practice is wide-ranging, and many practitioners weigh the risks and benefits of strategies of conservative as compared with liberal fluid management. In the conservative approach, fluid intake is restricted and urinary output is increased in an attempt to decrease lung edema, shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation, and improve survival. A possible risk of this approach is a decrease in cardiac output and worsening of nonpulmonary-organ function. The liberal fluid approach essentially reverses these potential priorities and risks.\nCurrent evidence is insufficient to support the use of either a liberal or conservative fluid strategy in patients with established acute lung injury.8–11 We conducted a prospective, randomized clinical trial to investigate the risks and benefits of a fluid-management protocol with a lower (conservative use of fluids) or higher (liberal use of fluids) intravascular pressure (as defined by the pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure or central venous pressure) in patients with acute lung injury. Our primary outcome was death from any cause at 60 days.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nThe complete protocol for this trial can be found in the Supplementary Appendix (available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org). Patients were randomly assigned to a strategy involving either conservative or liberal use of fluids with concealed allocation in permuted blocks of eight with the use of an automated system. Participants were simultaneously randomly assigned to receive either a pulmonary-artery catheter or a central venous catheter in a two-by-two factorial design.12\nInclusion Criteria\nEligible patients were intubated and received positive-pressure ventilation, had a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 300 (adjusted if the altitude exceeded 1000 m), and had bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography consistent with the presence of pulmonary edema without evidence of left atrial hypertension.13 If a potential participant did not have a central venous catheter, the primary physician's intent to insert one was required.\nExclusion Criteria\nReasons for exclusion are listed in the Supplementary Appendix. Major reasons for exclusion were the presence of a pulmonary-artery catheter after the onset of acute lung injury; the presence of acute lung injury for more than 48 hours; inability to obtain consent; the presence of chronic conditions that could independently influence survival, impair weaning, or compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g., severe lung or neuromuscular disease or dependence on dialysis); and irreversible conditions for which the estimated six-month mortality rate exceeded 50 percent, such as advanced cancer.\nStudy Procedures\nVentilation according to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Network protocol of lower tidal volumes was begun within one hour after randomization and continued until day 28; a protocol was used to wean patients from mechanical ventilation.14 The assigned catheter was inserted within four hours after randomization. Hemodynamic management was started within 2 hours after catheter insertion and continued for seven days or until 12 hours after a patient was able to breathe without assistance.14 After day 3, a pulmonary-artery catheter could be replaced by a central venous catheter if hemodynamic stability (i.e., absence of the need\n######################\nOutput:"

As compared with the liberal strategy, the conservative strategy improved the oxygenation index ([mean airway pressure×the ratio of the fraction of inspired oxygen to the partial pressure of arterial oxygen]×100) and the lung injury score and increased the number of ventilator-free days (14.6±0.5 vs. 12.1±0.5, P<0.001) and days not spent in the intensive care unit (13.4±0.4 vs. 11.2±0.4, P<0.001) during the first 28 days but did not increase the incidence or prevalence of shock during the study or the use of dialysis during the first 60 days (10 percent vs. 14 percent, P=0.06).\nConclusions\nAlthough there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of 60-day mortality, the conservative strategy of fluid management improved lung function and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care without increasing nonpulmonary-organ failures. These results support the use of a conservative strategy of fluid management in patients with acute lung injury. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00281268.)\nPulmonary edema resulting from increased capillary permeability, a hallmark of acute lung injury, worsens as intravascular hydrostatic pressure rises and oncotic pressure falls.1,2 Although lung failure alone can be lethal, death in patients with acute lung injury is usually due to the failure of nonpulmonary organs.1,3\nThe optimal fluid management of acute lung injury is not settled.4–7 The usual practice is wide-ranging, and many practitioners weigh the risks and benefits of strategies of conservative as compared with liberal fluid management. In the conservative approach, fluid intake is restricted and urinary output is increased in an attempt to decrease lung edema, shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation, and improve survival. A possible risk of this approach is a decrease in cardiac output and worsening of nonpulmonary-organ function. The liberal fluid approach essentially reverses these potential priorities and risks.\nCurrent evidence is insufficient to support the use of either a liberal or conservative fluid strategy in patients with established acute lung injury.8–11 We conducted a prospective, randomized clinical trial to investigate the risks and benefits of a fluid-management protocol with a lower (conservative use of fluids) or higher (liberal use of fluids) intravascular pressure (as defined by the pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure or central venous pressure) in patients with acute lung injury. Our primary outcome was death from any cause at 60 days.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nThe complete protocol for this trial can be found in the Supplementary Appendix (available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org). Patients were randomly assigned to a strategy involving either conservative or liberal use of fluids with concealed allocation in permuted blocks of eight with the use of an automated system. Participants were simultaneously randomly assigned to receive either a pulmonary-artery catheter or a central venous catheter in a two-by-two factorial design.12\nInclusion Criteria\nEligible patients were intubated and received positive-pressure ventilation, had a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 300 (adjusted if the altitude exceeded 1000 m), and had bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography consistent with the presence of pulmonary edema without evidence of left atrial hypertension.13 If a potential participant did not have a central venous catheter, the primary physician's intent to insert one was required.\nExclusion Criteria\nReasons for exclusion are listed in the Supplementary Appendix. Major reasons for exclusion were the presence of a pulmonary-artery catheter after the onset of acute lung injury; the presence of acute lung injury for more than 48 hours; inability to obtain consent; the presence of chronic conditions that could independently influence survival, impair weaning, or compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g., severe lung or neuromuscular disease or dependence on dialysis); and irreversible conditions for which the estimated six-month mortality rate exceeded 50 percent, such as advanced cancer.\nStudy Procedures\nVentilation according to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Network protocol of lower tidal volumes was begun within one hour after randomization and continued until day 28; a protocol was used to wean patients from mechanical ventilation.14 The assigned catheter was inserted within four hours after randomization. Hemodynamic management was started within 2 hours after catheter insertion and continued for seven days or until 12 hours after a patient was able to breathe without assistance.14 After day 3, a pulmonary-artery catheter could be replaced by a central venous catheter if hemodynamic stability (i.e., absence of the need"

During this period, the patients assigned to standard therapy had a significantly lower central venous oxygen saturation (P<0.001) and a greater base deficit (P=0.006) than those assigned to early goal-directed therapy; the two groups had similar lactate concentrations (P=0.62) and similar pH values (P=0.26).\nDuring the period from 7 to 72 hours after the start of treatment, the patients assigned to standard therapy had a significantly higher heart rate (P=0.04) and a significantly lower mean arterial pressure (P<0.001) than the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy; the two groups had a similar central venous pressure (P=0.68). During this period, those assigned to standard therapy also had a significantly lower central venous oxygen saturation than those assigned to early goal-directed therapy (P<0.001), as well as a higher lactate concentration (P=0.02), a greater base deficit (P<0.001), and a lower pH (P<0.001).\nOrgan Dysfunction and Coagulation Variables\nDuring the period from 7 to 72 hours, the APACHE II score, SAPS II, and MODS were significantly higher in the patients assigned to standard therapy than in the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy (P<0.001 for all comparisons) (Table 2). During this period, the prothrombin time was significantly greater in the patients assigned to standard therapy than in those assigned to early goal-directed therapy (P=0.001), as was the concentration of fibrin-split products (P<0.001) and the concentration of D-dimer (P=0.006). The two groups had a similar partial-thromboplastin time (P=0.06), fibrinogen concentration (P=0.21), and platelet count (P=0.51) (Table 2).\nMortality\nIn-hospital mortality rates were significantly higher in the standard-therapy group than in the early-therapy group (P=0.009), as was the mortality at 28 days (P=0.01) and 60 days (P=0.03) (Table 3). The difference between the groups in mortality at 60 days primarily reflected the difference in in-hospital mortality. Similar results were obtained after data from the 27 patients who did not complete the initial six-hour study period were excluded from the analysis (data not shown). The rate of in-hospital death due to sudden cardiovascular collapse was significantly higher in the standard-therapy group than in the early-therapy group (P=0.02); the rate of death due to multiorgan failure was similar in the two groups (P=0.27).\nTable 3\n\nKaplan–Meier Estimates of Mortality and Causes of In-Hospital Death.\nAdministered Treatments\nDuring the initial six hours, the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy received significantly more fluid than those assigned to standard therapy (P<0.001) and more frequently received red-cell transfusion (P<0.001) and inotropic support (P<0.001), whereas similar proportions of patients in the two groups required vasopressors (P=0.62) and mechanical ventilation (P=0.90) (Table 4). During the period from 7 to 72 hours, however, the patients assigned to standard therapy received significantly more fluid than those assigned to early goal-directed therapy (P=0.01) and more often received red-cell transfusion (P<0.001) and vasopressors (P=0.03) and underwent mechanical ventilation (P<0.001) and pulmonary-artery catheterization (P=0.04); the rate of use of inotropic agents was similar in the two groups (P=0.14) (Table 4). During the overall period from base line to 72 hours after the start of treatment, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the total volume of fluid administered (P=0.73) or the rate of use of inotropic agents (P=0.15), although a greater proportion of the patients assigned to standard therapy than of those assigned to early goal-directed therapy received vasopressors (P=0.02) and mechanical ventilation (P=0.02) and underwent pulmonary-artery catheterization (P=0.01), and a smaller proportion required red-cell transfusion (P<0.001). Though similar between the groups at base line (P=0.91), the mean hematocrit during this 72-hour period was significantly lower in the standard-therapy group than in the early-therapy group (P<0.001).

During the period from 7 to 72 hours, however, the patients assigned to standard therapy received significantly more fluid than those assigned to early goal-directed therapy (P=0.01) and more often received red-cell transfusion (P<0.001) and vasopressors (P=0.03) and underwent mechanical ventilation (P<0.001) and pulmonary-artery catheterization (P=0.04); the rate of use of inotropic agents was similar in the two groups (P=0.14) (Table 4). During the overall period from base line to 72 hours after the start of treatment, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the total volume of fluid administered (P=0.73) or the rate of use of inotropic agents (P=0.15), although a greater proportion of the patients assigned to standard therapy than of those assigned to early goal-directed therapy received vasopressors (P=0.02) and mechanical ventilation (P=0.02) and underwent pulmonary-artery catheterization (P=0.01), and a smaller proportion required red-cell transfusion (P<0.001). Though similar between the groups at base line (P=0.91), the mean hematocrit during this 72-hour period was significantly lower in the standard-therapy group than in the early-therapy group (P<0.001). Despite the transfusion of red cells, it was significantly lower than the value obtained at base line in each group (P<0.001 for both comparisons) (Table 2).\nTable 4\n\nTreatments Administered.\nConsumption of Health Care Resources\nThere were no significant differences between the two groups in the mean duration of vasopressor therapy (2.4±4.2 vs. 1.9±3.1 days, P=0.49), the mean duration of mechanical ventilation (9.0±13.1 vs. 9.0±11.4 days, P=0.38), or the mean length of stay in the hospital (13.0±13.7 vs. 13.2±13.8 days, P"

However, whether this blood-pressure target is more or less effective than a higher target is unknown.\nMethods\nIn a multicenter, open-label trial, we randomly assigned 776 patients with septic shock to undergo resuscitation with a mean arterial pressure target of either 80 to 85 mm Hg (high-target group) or 65 to 70 mm Hg (low-target group). The primary end point was mortality at day 28.\nResults\nAt 28 days, there was no significant between-group difference in mortality, with deaths reported in 142 of 388 patients in the high-target group (36.6%) and 132 of 388 patients in the low-target group (34.0%) (hazard ratio in the high-target group, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.38; P=0.57). There was also no significant difference in mortality at 90 days, with 170 deaths (43.8%) and 164 deaths (42.3%), respectively (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.30; P=0.74). The occurrence of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups (74 events [19.1%] and 69 events [17.8%], respectively; P=0.64). However, the incidence of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation was higher in the high-target group than in the low-target group. Among patients with chronic hypertension, those in the high-target group required less renal-replacement therapy than did those in the low-target group, but such therapy was not associated with a difference in mortality.\nConclusions\nTargeting a mean arterial pressure of 80 to 85 mm Hg, as compared with 65 to 70 mm Hg, in patients with septic shock undergoing resuscitation did not result in significant differences in mortality at either 28 or 90 days. (Funded by the French Ministry of Health; SEPSISPAM ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01149278.)\nSeptic shock is characterized by arterial hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation. The guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign1 recommended initial resuscitation with vasopressors to reverse hypotension, with a mean arterial pressure target of at least 65 mm Hg (grade 1C, indicating a strong recommendation with a low level of evidence). This recommendation is based on the findings of small studies, which showed no significant differences in lactate levels or regional blood flow when the mean arterial pressure was elevated to more than 65 mm Hg in patients with septic shock. 2,3\nHowever, as emphasized by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, for patients with atherosclerosis or previous hypertension, a higher blood-pressure target may be better. Accordingly, values for mean arterial pressure exceeding 65 mm Hg are frequently observed, as confirmed by data from large, prospective, randomized, controlled trials that focused on resuscitation of patients with septic shock, which showed that patients had mean arterial pressures in the range of 75 to 95 mm Hg 24 hours after inclusion.4–8 Moreover, a large, retrospective study showed that a mean arterial pressure of more than 75 mm Hg may be required to maintain kidney function.9 The notion that a higher blood pressure can be useful was confirmed in a small, prospective, observational study.10 Finally, a study of physiological mechanisms of chronic arterial hypertension showed that such hypertension causes a rightward shift in cerebral pressure-flow autoregulation, which might justify targeting a higher mean arterial pressure.11\nSince the selection of effective blood-pressure targets is still controversial, we conducted a multicenter, randomized, stratified, open-label trial involving patients with septic shock to determine whether targeting a mean arterial pressure of 80 to 85 mm Hg would decrease 28-day mortality, as compared with targeting a mean arterial pressure of 65 to 70 mm Hg. We also postulated that the beneficial effects of a higher target would be more pronounced among patients with chronic hypertension. Therefore, at randomization, patients were stratified according to whether they had a history of chronic hypertension.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nFrom March 2010 through December 2011, we enrolled patients at 29 centers in France. The study was approved for all centers by the ethics committee at the Angers University Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, their next of kin, or another surrogate decision maker, as appropriate. If patients were unable to provide informed consent and neither their next of kin nor other designated person was available, a procedure for inclusion in the study in emergency situations was applied. A definitive post hoc consent form was ultimately obtained from patients who survived but had been initially treated on the basis of the emergency consent.\nRandomization was performed with the use of a computer-generated assignment sequence in a centralized, blinded fashion and was stratified according to whether patients had chronic hypertension (i.e., had been receiving antihypertensive treatment or had a history of arterial hypertension). Given the pragmatic character of the trial, it was impossible to obtain details on the patients' adherence to the antihypertensive drug regimen or the adequacy of the antihypertensive treatment during the inclusion time window. Patients, research staff members, and members of the safety and writing committees were unaware of the study-group assignments.\nStudy Oversight\nThe data and safety monitoring committee oversaw the trial conduct and the safety of the patients, with interim analyses performed after the inclusion of 200, 400, and 600 patients.\n######################\nOutput:"

Investigators’ adherence to guidelines was checked at each investigators’ meeting.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at ICU discharge, hospital discharge, day 28, and day 180; the percentage of patients from whom care was withheld or withdrawn; the percentage of patients weaned from vasopressors at day 28 and day 90; the time to weaning from vasopressors; the number of days that patients were alive and free of vasopressors (vasopressor-free days) up to day 28 and day 90 (patients who died before day 28 or day 90 were assigned zero free days); the percentage of patients weaned from mechanical ventilation at day 28 and day 90; the time to weaning from mechanical ventilation; ventilator-free days up to day 28 and day 90; the percentage of patients with a total SOFA score below 6 (organ-failure–free) at day 28 and day 90; the time to reaching a SOFA score below 6; organ-failure–free days up to day 28 and day 90; the percentage of patients discharged from the ICU and hospital up to day 28 and day 90; the time to discharge from the ICU and hospital; and ICU-free and hospital-free days up to day 28 and day 90.\nSafety outcomes included superinfection up to day 180, gastrointestinal bleeding up to day 28, episodes of hyperglycemia up to day 7, and neurologic sequelae (cognitive impairment and muscle weakness) at the time of ICU and hospital discharge, day 90, and day 180. All adverse events were recorded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities classification (Tables S13 and S14 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nStatistical Analysis\nWe anticipated a 90-day mortality of 45% among patients with septic shock.19 According to the 2-by-2 factorial design with a two-sided formulation, 320 patients were needed in each group (i.e., a total of 1280 patients) to detect an absolute difference of 10 percentage points in 90-day mortality (α=0.05 and power at 95%) between either drotrecogin alfa (activated) or corticosteroids and placebo. An intention-to-treat analysis was planned to be performed after all the participants had completed the 180-day follow-up and according to the 2-by-2 factorial design.13 Owing to the withdrawal of Xigris from the market in 2011, the trial continued with two parallel groups (see the protocol) and was underpowered to assess the effect of drotrecogin alfa (activated). The sponsor terminated the trial when the expiration dates of the trial agents were reached and 1241 patients (97% of the expected sample size) had been enrolled.\nThe analysis compared all the patients assigned to receive hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone with those assigned to receive corresponding placebos. Continuous variables are presented as means and standard deviations. Categorical variables are presented as the number of patients in each category and the corresponding percentages. Missing data were not replaced. The effects of trial agents on the frequency of fatal events (mortality at day 28, at day 90, at discharge from the ICU or hospital, and at day 180) and safety outcomes were compared with the use of logistic-regression models and the chi-square test. Continuous variables were compared with the use of analyses of variance and t-tests. Cumulative event curves (censored end points) were estimated with the Kaplan–Meier procedure, and Cox models and the log-rank test were used to compare the effects of trial agents (time to ICU and hospital discharge). The Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard regression models, which extend the Cox model to competing risk data by considering the hazard function associated with the cumulative incidence function, were used to compare the effects of trial agents (time to weaning from vasopressors, to weaning from mechanical ventilation, and to reaching a SOFA score <6). No adjustment for multiple testing was made. All analyses were conducted with SAS statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\nResults\nBaseline Patient Characteristics\nThere were 34 participating centers. The first and last patients were recruited on September 2, 2008, and June 23, 2015, respectively. The trial was suspended twice: first, from October 25, 2011, to May 12, 2012, after the withdrawal of Xigris from the market, and second, at the request of the data and safety monitoring board, from July 22, 2014, to October 7, 2014, to check the quality of the trial agents and the distribution of serious adverse events.13 On October 1, 2014, the data and safety monitoring board confirmed the conformity of the trial to the marketing-authorization application for fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone and the quality of their placebos; the board also confirmed that the distribution of serious adverse events between the groups did not justify halting the trial. The trial was completed on December 23, 2015 (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Table 1 shows the primary baseline characteristics of the patients. (See also Tables S1 through S7 in the Supplementary Appendix.) Patient demographic data, severity-of-illness scores, characteristics of infection, and treatments at baseline were similar in the two groups.

Martin and coworkers11 randomly assigned 37 patients with hypoproteinemia and acute lung injury to receive either a five-day specified regimen of furosemide and colloid replacement or placebo infusions. The treated group had an increase in the PaO2:FiO2 within 24 hours. We do not know whether using lung-water measurements to drive protocol instructions or increasing the use of colloid would have increased the benefits of the conservative strategy in our study.\nThe hemodynamic consequences of the conservative strategy were small and apparently of minimal clinical significance. Although the mean arterial pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac index were slightly lower in the conservative-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group, there were no significant differences in mixed venous oxygenation or in the incidence or duration of shock. Although the conservative strategy was associated with a slightly higher blood urea nitrogen level, the creatinine level, the number of days without renal failure, and the need for dialysis were similar in the two groups. Possible reasons for the greater number of days without central nervous system failure in the conservative-strategy group include a reduced incidence of cerebral edema, differences in acid–base status, or a lower rate of use of sedation as improved lung function permitted earlier removal from the ventilator. The available data are not sufficient to distinguish among these or other potential explanations.\nThe protocols were designed to minimize risks. During shock, physicians treated patients according to their usual practice. Because of concern that a conservative approach might worsen cardiovascular or renal function, diuretic administration was suspended until 12 hours after a fluid bolus or the reversal of shock, and prompt fluid administration was provided in the event of oliguria or ineffective circulation. Diuretic therapy was titrated on the basis of the patient's response, avoided in patients with worsening renal function, and limited to a daily maximum. To minimize the risk of excessive fluid therapy, protocol-mandated fluid administration in patients without shock was limited to three boluses per day and was withheld in patients without shock who had severe hypoxemia (FiO2≥0.7) or a cardiac index of at least 4.5 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area.\nElectrolyte levels were managed by the clinician. The conservative-strategy group had a higher partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, arterial pH, and bicarbonate level than did the liberal-strategy group. Although mean differences between the groups in the serum sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate levels were small, a higher percentage of patients in the conservative-strategy group had at least one potassium value between 2.5 and 3.0 mmol per liter, at least one sodium value of 150 mmol per liter or more, and at least one bicarbonate value of 40 mmol per liter or more. Hence, close monitoring of electrolyte levels is warranted during diuretic therapy.\nSince we tested specific management strategies that used several variables and safeguards, we do not know whether the safety and benefit of the conservative protocol could be realized by using the simplified target of a zero fluid balance. Departures from the specific hemodynamic and ventilator protocols used in this trial may lead to clinical outcomes that differ from those observed in this study.\nIn conclusion, we found that use of a conservative fluid-management protocol with a lower central venous pressure or pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure target resulted in a major reduction in net fluid balance without an increase in adverse events, as compared with a liberal fluid-management protocol targeting higher intravascular filling pressures. Although we did not detect a difference in the mortality rate between the two approaches, the conservative strategy improved lung function and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care, without increasing nonpulmonary organ failures. These results support the use of a conservative strategy of fluid management in patients with acute lung injury.\n######################\nOutput:"

The data were collected by the investigators and analyzed by the data management committee. The executive committee vouches for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analysis. The article was written by the writing committee, and the decision to publish was made by the executive committee. Full details of the trial protocol can be found in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org.\nStudy Patients\nPatients older than 16 years of age who had septic shock that was resistant to fluids (as defined by lack of response to 500 ml of normal saline or a requirement for vasopressors [see the Supplementary Appendix]) and low-dose norepinephrine were considered for enrollment. Septic shock was defined by the presence of two or more diagnostic criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome,15 proven or suspected infection, new dysfunction of at least one organ, and hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation (requiring vasopressor support consisting of at least 5 μg of norepinephrine or the equivalent per minute [see the Supplementary Appendix] for 6 hours). Exclusion criteria are listed in the Supplementary Appendix.\nTreatment Assignments\nTreatment with either vasopressin or norepinephrine was assigned by means of a central telephone randomization system accessed by the study pharmacists at the participating institutions. A computer-generated randomization list of variable permuted blocks of 2, 4, and 6 was used for treatment allocation, which was stratified by center and by severity of shock in the hour before randomization (the stratum of less severe septic shock was defined as treatment with 5 to 14 μg of norepinephrine or the equivalent per minute, and the stratum of more severe septic shock was defined as treatment with 15 μg or more of norepinephrine or the equivalent per minute). Infusions of both study drugs were prepared locally by study pharmacists who were aware of the two treatments. All other clinical staff, investigators, research personnel, patients, and families were unaware of the treatment assignments for the duration of the trial.\nDrug Infusion\nVasopressin (30 U) and norepinephrine (15 mg) were mixed in identical 250-ml intravenous bags of 5% dextrose in water, with final concentrations of 0.12 U of vasopressin per milliliter and 60 μg of norepinephrine per milliliter. The study-drug infusion was started at 5 ml per hour and increased by 2.5 ml per hour every 10 minutes during the first hour to achieve a constant target rate of 15 ml per hour. Thus, the blinded vasopressin infusion was started at 0.01 U per minute and titrated to a maximum of 0.03 U per minute, whereas the blinded norepinephrine infusion was started at 5 μg per minute and titrated to a maximum of 15 μg per minute.\nDuring the initiation and titration of the study drug, the bedside nurse also titrated open-label vasopressors to maintain a constant target mean arterial pressure. An initial target mean arterial pressure of 65 to 75 mm Hg was recommended; however, the attending ICU physician could modify the target blood pressure of each patient.\nOpen-label vasopressors were increased only if the target mean arterial pressure was not reached on maximal study-drug infusion. Tapering of open-label vasopressors was permitted only when the target mean arterial pressure had been reached during the study-drug infusion. Tapering of the study drug was commenced only when the target mean arterial pressure had been maintained for 8 hours without any open-label vasopressors. Infusion of the study drug was continued at 15 ml per hour until the patient died, a serious adverse event occurred, or the patient's condition improved to the extent that open-label vasopressors were no longer required. Neither crossover to the other group nor open-label vasopressin was permitted.\nThe study-drug infusion was discontinued or interrupted if any of the following predetermined serious adverse events occurred: acute ST-segment elevation confirmed by a 12-lead electrocardiogram, serious or life-threatening (hemodynamically unstable) cardiac arrhythmias, acute mesenteric ischemia, digital ischemia, or hyponatremia (serum sodium level, <130 mmol per liter). If the clinical team noted an adverse event that they considered to be related to the study drug, then the study drug was discontinued for at least 8 hours and a serious adverse event was reported. The study drug could be restarted if, in the judgment of the investigator or attending physician, the adverse event had been treated, the condition had been reversed, and the event was not thought to have been a result of the study drug or study protocol.\nIf vasopressor support was required during the same admission to the ICU after a patient had been weaned from the study drug, the study drug was preferentially reinfused, as long as no exclusion criteria were met. In a subgroup of patients at six of the participating institutions, plasma was collected for measurement of circulating vasopressin levels (see the Supplementary Appendix).\nEnd Points\nThe primary outcome was death from any cause and was assessed 28 days after the start of infusions. Secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality; days alive and free of organ dysfunction during the first 28 days according to the Brussels criteria16 (see the Supplementary Appendix); days alive and free of vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation, or renal replacement therapy; days alive and free of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, defined as freedom from two or more of the four diagnostic criteria for the systemic inflammatory response\n######################\nOutput:"

Similarly, there was no significant difference in mortality at 90 days (43.9% and 49.6%, respectively; P=0.11; 95% CI for absolute risk reduction, −1.3 to 12.8%) or in rates of organ dysfunction (Table 2). The results remained nonsignificant after multivariate logistic-regression analysis (odds ratio for death in the vasopressin group at 28 days, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.26]; odds ratio for death at 90 days, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.57 to 1.16]).\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan–Meier Survival Curves for Patients Who Underwent Randomization and Infusion.\nTable 2\n\nAnalysis of the Rates and Risks of Death from Any Cause and Secondary Outcomes.\nThere were no significant differences in the overall rates or specific categories of serious adverse events between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups (overall rates, 10.3% and 10.5%, respectively; P=1.00) (Table 3). There was a trend toward a higher rate of cardiac arrest in the norepinephrine group than in the vasopressin group (2.1% vs. 0.8%, P=0.14) and a trend toward a higher rate of digital ischemia in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group (2.0% vs. 0.5%, P=0.11).\nTable 3\n\nSerious Adverse Events in Patients Who Had Septic Shock.\nIn the subgroup of patients in whom plasma vasopressin levels were measured, the levels were extremely low at baseline (median, 3.2 pmol per liter; interquartile range, 1.7 to 4.9). These levels did not change in the norepinephrine group. Infusion of low-dose vasopressin increased vasopressin levels to medians of 73.6 pmol per liter (interquartile range, 58.6 to 94.7) at 6 hours and 98.0 pmol per liter (interquartile range, 67.1 to 127.8) at 24 hours (Fig. 3 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nBaseline characteristics of the patients in the stratum of more severe septic shock and those in the stratum of less severe septic shock are presented in the Supplementary Appendix. Among patients who had less severe septic shock (an infusion of 5 to 14 μg of norepinephrine per minute at randomization), there were trends in favor of the vasopressin group with respect to both 28-day and 90-day mortality (Table 4). In contrast, there were no significant differences in mortality between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups in the stratum of more severe septic shock. However, the test for the interaction between the treatment assignment and the severity-of-shock subgroup was not significant (P=0.10). We performed several additional post hoc analyses of the results stratified according to different indicators of illness severity (Table 3 of the Supplementary Appendix). For most of these analyses, there was no evidence of a significant interaction between illness severity and vasopressin effect. Two of the interaction analyses (stratification according to quartile of lactate level and according to number of vasopressors at baseline) yielded moderately significant P values (P=0.04 for both), suggesting a possible advantage of vasopressin in patients with less severe shock (Table 3 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 4\n\nRates and Risks of Death from Any Cause According to the Severity of Shock.\nDiscussion\nIn this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial of low-dose vasopressin as compared with norepinephrine in patients with septic shock, we were not able to demonstrate any significant difference in the 28-day mortality rate (35.4% in the vasopressin group vs. 39.3% in the norepinephrine group, P=0.26). We were also unable to demonstrate any significant difference between the two study groups in 90-day mortality or the rate of organ dysfunction. There was no difference in the rates of serious adverse events between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups. Infusions of low-dose vasopressin (0.03 U per minute) increased plasma vasopressin levels to approximately 70 to 100 pmol per liter from extremely low baseline vasopressin levels (median, 3.2 pmol per liter). Consistent with at least 14 previous trials in humans10–14,20–28 of low-dose vasopressin (≤0.1 U per minute), vasopressin infusion allowed a rapid decrease in the total norepinephrine dose while maintaining mean arterial pressure.10–12,29\nOur study was prospectively powered to detect an absolute difference in mortality of 10%\n######################\nOutput:"

We hypothesized that therapy with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone or with drotrecogin alfa (activated), which can modulate the host response, would improve the clinical outcomes of patients with septic shock.\nMethods\nIn this multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design, we evaluated the effect of hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone therapy, drotrecogin alfa (activated), the combination of the three drugs, or their respective placebos. The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included mortality at intensive care unit (ICU) discharge and hospital discharge and at day 28 and day 180 and the number of days alive and free of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, or organ failure. After drotrecogin alfa (activated) was withdrawn from the market, the trial continued with a two-group parallel design. The analysis compared patients who received hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone with those who did not (placebo group).\nResults\nAmong the 1241 patients included in the trial, the 90-day mortality was 43.0% (264 of 614 patients) in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group and 49.1% (308 of 627 patients) in the placebo group (P=0.03). The relative risk of death in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.99). Mortality was significantly lower in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group than in the placebo group at ICU discharge (35.4% vs. 41.0%, P=0.04), hospital discharge (39.0% vs. 45.3%, P=0.02), and day 180 (46.6% vs. 52.5%, P=0.04) but not at day 28 (33.7% and 38.9%, respectively; P=0.06). The number of vasopressor-free days to day 28 was significantly higher in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group than in the placebo group (17 vs. 15 days, P<0.001), as was the number of organ-failure–free days (14 vs. 12 days, P=0.003). The number of ventilator-free days was similar in the two groups (11 days in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group and 10 in the placebo group, P=0.07). The rate of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups, but hyperglycemia was more common in hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group.\nConclusions\nIn this trial involving patients with septic shock, 90-day all-cause mortality was lower among those who received hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than among those who received placebo. (Funded by Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique 2007 of the French Ministry of Social Affairs and Health; APROCCHSS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00625209.)\nSeptic shock is characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection, resulting in life-threatening circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities.1 The short-term mortality is approximately 45 to 50%,2 and 50% of survivors of sepsis may have subsequent long-term cognitive decline.3 Apart from early hemodynamic and respiratory resuscitation and appropriate antiinfective treatments, there is no approved adjunct therapy for sepsis.4 A human recombinant activated protein C, drotrecogin alpha (activated), initially showed a survival benefit in sepsis; this benefit was not confirmed in subsequent trials, resulting in the withdrawal of its commercial form (Xigris) from the market.5,6\nExperimental and clinical evidence suggests that sepsis is associated with a dysregulated response of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis that may involve any of the steps from cortisol production to cortisol use by cells.7 Corticosteroids have been used in the treatment of patients with severe infections since the mid-twentieth century. However, their benefit-to-risk ratio, albeit evaluated in numerous trials, remains controversial. Quantitative analysis of these trials has variably confirmed8 or refuted9 the survival benefit of corticosteroids in patients with sepsis. This has resulted in substantial heterogeneity in physicians’ clinical practice, with approximately one third of physicians believing that corticosteroids improve survival in septic shock, one third believing that they do not, and one third being unsure.10\nThis uncertainty about the use of corticosteroids may relate to the differences in the results of the two largest trials.11,12 Although both trials showed treatment benefits in terms of hemodynamic status and organ function, only one trial11 showed survival benefits. The divergent findings may have resulted from differences in the design of the trials.13 To resolve this discrepancy, we designed a trial to test the hypothesis that hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone therapy or drotrecogin alfa (activated) would improve the clinical outcomes of patients with septic shock.\nMethods\nTrial Design and Oversight\nInformation on the design and conduct of the Activated Protein C and Corticosteroids for Human Septic Shock (APROCCHSS) trial, including the trial protocol and amendments and the statistical\n######################\nOutput:"

We evaluated the effect of early application of prone positioning on outcomes in patients with severe ARDS.\nMethods\nIn this multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned 466 patients with severe ARDS to undergo prone-positioning sessions of at least 16 hours or to be left in the supine position. Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 150 mm Hg, with an FiO2 of at least 0.6, a positive end-expiratory pressure of at least 5 cm of water, and a tidal volume close to 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died from any cause within 28 days after inclusion.\nResults\nA total of 237 patients were assigned to the prone group, and 229 patients were assigned to the supine group. The 28-day mortality was 16.0% in the prone group and 32.8% in the supine group (P<0.001). The hazard ratio for death with prone positioning was 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.63). Unadjusted 90-day mortality was 23.6% in the prone group versus 41.0% in the supine group (P<0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.67). The incidence of complications did not differ significantly between the groups, except for the incidence of cardiac arrests, which was higher in the supine group.\nConclusions\nIn patients with severe ARDS, early application of prolonged prone-positioning sessions significantly decreased 28-day and 90-day mortality.

Randomized, controlled trials have confirmed that oxygenation is significantly better when patients are in the prone position than when they are in the supine position.1,2 Furthermore, several lines of evidence have shown that prone positioning could prevent ventilator-induced lung injury.3–6 In several previous trials, these physiological benefits did not translate into better patient outcomes, since no significant improvement was observed in patient survival with prone positioning.7–10 However, meta-analyses2,11 have suggested that survival is significantly improved with prone positioning as compared with supine positioning among patients with severely hypoxemic ARDS at the time of randomization. We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to explore whether early application of prone positioning would improve survival among patients with ARDS who, at the time of enrollment, were receiving mechanical ventilation with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of at least 5 cm of water and in whom the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was less than 150 mm Hg.\nMethods\nPatients\nWe included in the study adults who met the following criteria: ARDS, as defined according to the American–European Consensus Conference criteria12; endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for ARDS for less than 36 hours; and severe ARDS (defined as a PaO2:FiO2 ratio of <150 mm Hg, with an FiO2 of ≥0.6, a PEEP of ≥5 cm of water, and a tidal volume of about 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight; the criteria were confirmed after 12 to 24 hours of mechanical ventilation in the participating intensive care unit [ICU]). Exclusion criteria are listed in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nTrial Design\nPatients were recruited from 26 ICUs in France and 1 in Spain, all of which have used prone positioning in daily practice for more than 5 years. Randomization was computer-generated and stratified according to ICU. Patients were randomly assigned to the prone group or supine group with the use of a centralized Web-based management system (Clininfo). The protocol, available at NEJM.org, was approved by the ethics committee Comité Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biomedicale Sud-Est IV in Lyon, France, and by the Clinical Investigation Ethics Committee at Hospital de Sant Pau in Barcelona. Written informed consent was obtained after the patients' next of kin read the informational leaflet. If patients were able to read the leaflet at some point after inclusion in the study, they were approached to confirm participation in the trial. An investigator at each center was responsible for enrolling patients in the study, following the protocol, and completing the case-report form. Centers were regularly monitored by research fellows. Data collectors were aware of the study-group assignments, but outcomes assessors were not.\nThe trial was overseen by a steering committee that met monthly. An independent data and safety monitoring board, comprising three experts in the field, was also set up (a list of board members is provided in the Supplementary Appendix). There was no commercial support. No one who is not listed as an author contributed to the writing of this manuscript. All authors vouch for the accuracy\n######################\nOutput:"

Tapering was used because of the increase in proinflammatory mediators and hemodynamic deterioration after abrupt cessation of corticosteroids.17 Our study showed an increased incidence of superinfection, including new episodes of sepsis or septic shock, in the hydrocortisone group. Previous studies with high-dose corticosteroids have shown similar findings,11 whereas the study conducted by the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Network32 using higher doses of corticosteroids and meta-analyses of studies that used low doses21,22 did not report higher rates of infectious complications.\nStudies involving critically ill patients have reported an association between corticosteroid therapy and the incidence of neuromuscular weakness.32,33 We did not see this in our study, although electrophysiological testing was not performed. However, the duration of mechanical ventilation was similar in the two study groups. Finally, the increased glucose levels in the hydrocortisone group may have contributed to increased mortality.34\nThe use of etomidate for induction of anesthesia in our study (in 26% of patients) was similar to that in the Annane study (24%). Etomidate has a low profile of cardiovascular complications,35 but a single dose can inhibit the metabolism of corticosteroids for at least 24 hours in patients who are critically ill.36 An association between etomidate and the likelihood of adrenal hyporesponsiveness was also found in our study.\nThe prognostic importance of adrenal insufficiency in septic shock is well described.19 Routine testing of adrenal function has been advocated to guide corticosteroid therapy.16,18–21 In our study, a modest increase in the rate of death at 28 days was seen in patients who did not have a response to corticotropin (38%), as compared with those who had a response (29%). However, there was no difference in outcome in either subgroup of the hydrocortisone group. The short corticotropin test does not appear to be useful for determining the advisability of corticosteroid treatment in patients with septic shock, and our results call into question the definition of relative adrenal insufficiency. Indeed, significant variability in cortisol levels has been described, depending on the measurement methods used.37 Studies have described the poor relationship between total and free cortisol levels38 and other issues concerning the dose, timing, and type of corticotropin.39\nThe strengths of our study include the fact that it was initiated by the investigators and involved 52 ICUs in nine countries. Limitations include the lack of adequate power, since only 500 patients were enrolled rather than the projected 800. This was due to a combination of slow recruitment (which was probably related to a loss of equipoise in view of the various guidelines recommending corticosteroid use23), termination of funding, and time expiry of the trial drug. On the basis of the current data, however, the likelihood of seeing any difference in outcomes between the two study groups was unlikely. Finally, 21 patients received open-label corticosteroids (4.2%), although this finding was unlikely to have had a material effect on the outcome.\nIn summary, the use of hydrocortisone did not decrease mortality in a general population of patients with septic shock, even though the drug hastened reversal of shock. This lack of improvement may be related to an increased incidence of superinfection and new septic episodes. No benefit was seen in a subgroup of patients who had had no response to corticotropin, as was shown previously for patients with severe septic shock. This finding may be related to methodologic issues surrounding the accurate diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients or to a decreased prognostic importance of this phenomenon in less severe shock. On the basis of these findings, hydrocortisone cannot be recommended as general adjuvant therapy for septic shock (vasopressor responsive), nor can corticotropin testing be recommended to determine which patients should receive hydrocortisone therapy. Hydrocortisone may have a role among patients who are treated early after the onset of septic shock who remain hypotensive despite the administration of high-dose vasopressors (vasopressor unresponsive).\n######################\nOutput:"

There were no significant interactions between baseline shock status and treatment with respect to the mortality rate or the number of ventilator-free days or ICU-free days (Table 3 of the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 3\n\nProbability of Survival to Hospital Discharge and of Breathing without Assistance during the First 60 Days after Randomization.\nTable 3\n\nMain Outcome Variables.\nBlack patients had a higher overall rate of death (37.3 percent of 118 black patients in the liberal-strategy group and 31.3 percent of 99 black patients in the conservative-strategy group) than white patients (22.7 percent of 313 white patients in the liberal-strategy group and 23.5 percent of 328 white patients in the conservative-strategy group) (P=0.002). Hispanic patients also had a higher mortality rate (38.5 percent of 52 Hispanic patients in the liberal-strategy group and 23.0 percent of 61 Hispanic patients in the conservative-strategy group) than whites, but this difference did not reach significance (P=0.10). After adjustment for baseline covariates, the hazard ratio for death among blacks as compared with whites was not significant (hazard ratio, 1.29; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.73), whereas it was significant for Hispanics (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 2.31). The interaction between treatment and race for whites as compared with nonwhites was not significant (P=0.10), nor was it significant in any of the racial or ethnic subgroups. There was also no significant interaction between treatment and sex.\nDiscussion\nAlthough we did not detect a significant difference between the conservative strategy and the liberal strategy of fluid management in the primary outcome of 60-day mortality, the conservative strategy improved lung function and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care without increasing nonpulmonary-organ failures. The overall difference in mortality according to race or ethnic group has previously been described in patients with acute lung injury22 and could be due to several factors, including socioeconomic disparities or genetic determinants.23\nThe two strategies were designed to be prudent but distinctly different approaches to fluid therapy. To place the results of our study in context, it is useful to consider how these fluid strategies compare with usual practice. In this regard, it is of interest that the cumulative seven-day fluid balance in the liberal-strategy group (6992±502 ml) was similar to that among patients in ARDS Network studies in which the approach to fluid management was not specified14,24 (Figure 1 of the Supplementary Appendix). These findings are similar to those reported by Simmons et al.8 in 1987, suggesting that the liberal approach to fluid management reflects long-standing practices. The usual practice resembles the liberal approach in another aspect: the prestudy baseline measurements for central venous pressure (12.2 mm Hg) and pulmonary-artery–occlusion pressure (15.7 mm Hg) were both within the target ranges for the liberal fluid strategy (10 to 14 mm Hg and 14 to 18 mm Hg, respectively).\nComparisons of our study to other studies of goal-directed management in critically ill patients are problematic because of differences in protocols, patient populations, and timing of the interventions. Whereas we targeted central venous pressure or pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure in patients with recent onset of acute lung injury, previous studies targeted the cardiac index, oxygen delivery, or mixed venous oxygen saturation in heterogeneous populations of critically ill patients.25–31 Rivers et al.32 demonstrated in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock the efficacy of six hours of early, goal-directed resuscitation in the emergency department before admission to the ICU. In contrast, our patients received their first protocol intervention an average of 43 hours after admission to the ICU and 24 hours after meeting the criteria for acute lung injury.\nThe conservative-strategy group had higher serum oncotic pressures and lower intravascular pressures — characteristics that would be expected to limit the development of pulmonary edema. With lung injury, small increases in the pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure are associated with large increases in extravascular lung water.2 The higher albumin and hemoglobin levels in the conservative-strategy group appear to be primarily related to hemoconcentration (or less hemodilution), since the rate of albumin use was low and not significantly different between groups and red-cell transfusions were more frequent in the liberal-strategy group.\nOur results are consistent with those obtained in studies in animals suggesting improved lung function with diuretics and fluid restriction33–37 and with the results of observational studies\n######################\nOutput:"

Therefore, we may not have detected differences in the incidence of some adverse events, especially rare events such as myocardial infarction.\nSeptic shock is a major risk factor for atrial fibrillation,17 and in our study, atrial fibrillation was significantly more common in the high-target group than in the low-target group. This adverse effect might be related to the significantly higher doses of catecholamine and the longer duration of catecholamine infusions in the high-target group. However, given the small number of episodes of atrial fibrillation, other confounding factors cannot be ruled out. The association between atrial fibrillation and septic shock should be considered only as a hypothesis-generating concept for future trials.\nAt randomization, patients were stratified according of the presence or absence of chronic hypertension. More than 40% of the patients reported having a history of chronic hypertension, which is in line with rates in previous studies.18 Among patients with chronic hypertension, a rightward shift of the curve for organ pressure-flow autoregulation is expected, which means that an increased mean arterial pressure could hypothetically result in improved organ perfusion11 and, eventually, in improved survival rates. No significant differences in adverse effects between patients with chronic hypertension and those without chronic hypertension were evident. The results in the subgroup with chronic hypertension may indicate that targeting a higher mean arterial pressure is acceptable because it was not associated with greater harms.\nThe guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommend targeting a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mm Hg. According to our study design, investigators were invited to follow these guidelines in the low-target group. However, the observed mean arterial pressures in the low-target group (target range, 65 to 70 mm Hg) were for the most part between 70 and 75 mm Hg. Similarly, the observed values in the high-target group were also higher (between 85 and 90 mm Hg) than the predefined target range of 80 to 85 mm Hg. Thus, the target between-group difference was well maintained. Whether higher achieved mean arterial pressures in the two groups influenced the results is impossible to ascertain. However, given the pragmatic nature of the trial, these data were not recorded as protocol violations. In addition, the higher mean arterial pressures in the two groups may reflect the reluctance of some attending physicians to decrease the vasopressor infusion rate when the mean arterial pressure is about 70 mm Hg, as recently reported by Poukkanen et al.19 In that study, patients spent more than 75% of the time at a mean arterial pressure of more than 70 mm Hg. Finally, the generalizability of our trial results may be limited because of the frequent use of glucocorticoids and activated protein C and because of the large number of patients who were excluded because of the narrow inclusion window.\nIn conclusion, among patients with septic shock, 28-day and 90-day mortality did not differ significantly between those who were treated to reach a target mean arterial pressure of 80 to 85 mm Hg and those who were treated to reach a target of 65 to 70 mm Hg.\n######################\nOutput:"

        "text": "rate of death led to an underpowered study. Therefore, we may not have detected differences in the incidence of some adverse events, especially rare events such as myocardial infarction.\nSeptic shock is a major risk factor for atrial fibrillation,17 and in our study, atrial fibrillation was significantly more common in the high-target group than in the low-target group. This adverse effect might be related to the significantly higher doses of catecholamine and the longer duration of catecholamine infusions in the high-target group. However, given the small number of episodes of atrial fibrillation, other confounding factors cannot be ruled out. The association between atrial fibrillation and septic shock should be considered only as a hypothesis-generating concept for future trials.\nAt randomization, patients were stratified according of the presence or absence of chronic hypertension. More than 40% of the patients reported having a history of chronic hypertension, which is in line with rates in previous studies.18 Among patients with chronic hypertension, a rightward shift of the curve for organ pressure-flow autoregulation is expected, which means that an increased mean arterial pressure could hypothetically result in improved organ perfusion11 and, eventually, in improved survival rates. No significant differences in adverse effects between patients with chronic hypertension and those without chronic hypertension were evident. The results in the subgroup with chronic hypertension may indicate that targeting a higher mean arterial pressure is acceptable because it was not associated with greater harms.\nThe guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommend targeting a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mm Hg. According to our study design, investigators were invited to follow these guidelines in the low-target group. However, the observed mean arterial pressures in the low-target group (target range, 65 to 70 mm Hg) were for the most part between 70 and 75 mm Hg. Similarly, the observed values in the high-target group were also higher (between 85 and 90 mm Hg) than the predefined target range of 80 to 85 mm Hg. Thus, the target between-group difference was well maintained. Whether higher achieved mean arterial pressures in the two groups influenced the results is impossible to ascertain. However, given the pragmatic nature of the trial, these data were not recorded as protocol violations. In addition, the higher mean arterial pressures in the two groups may reflect the reluctance of some attending physicians to decrease the vasopressor infusion rate when the mean arterial pressure is about 70 mm Hg, as recently reported by Poukkanen et al.19 In that study, patients spent more than 75% of the time at a mean arterial pressure of more than 70 mm Hg. Finally, the generalizability of our trial results may be limited because of the frequent use of glucocorticoids and activated protein C and because of the large number of patients who were excluded because of the narrow inclusion window.\nIn conclusion, among patients with septic shock, 28-day and 90-day mortality did not differ significantly between those who were treated to reach a target mean arterial pressure of 80 to 85 mm Hg and those who were treated to reach a target of 65 to 70 mm Hg."

After adjustment for multiple comparisons, there was no significant between-group difference in the number of days alive and out of the ICU (P=0.047; threshold level for significance after adjustment for multiple comparisons, P=0.005) (Table 2, and Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nPatients in the hydrocortisone group had a shorter duration of the initial episode of mechanical ventilation than did those in the placebo group (median, 6 days [interquartile range, 3 to 18] vs. 7 days [interquartile range, 3 to 24]; hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.22; P<0.001), but taking into account episodes of recurrence of ventilation, there were no significant differences in the number of days alive and free from mechanical ventilation (Table 2, and Fig. S6G and S6H in the Supplementary Appendix).\nThere were no significant between-group differences with respect to the rate of recurrence of shock, the time to hospital discharge, the number of days alive and out of hospital, the rate of recurrence of mechanical ventilation, the duration and rate of use of renal-replacement therapy, and the rate of development of new-onset bacteremia or fungemia (Table 2, and Fig. S6E and S6F in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFewer patients in the hydrocortisone group than in the placebo group received a blood transfusion (37.0% vs. 41.7%; odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94; P=0.004). Among the patients who received a transfusion, there was no significant between-group difference with respect to the mean total volume of blood transfused (Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nAdverse Events\nA total of 33 adverse events was reported in the trial population, with a higher percentage in the hydrocortisone group than in the placebo group (1.1% vs. 0.3%, P=0.009). There were 6 serious adverse events, with 4 occurring in the hydrocortisone group and 2 in the placebo group (Table 3). The list of protocol violations and the results of the interim analyses are presented in Tables S12 and S13, respectively, in the Supplementary Appendix.\nTable 3\n\nAdverse Events.\nDiscussion\nWe found that the administration of hydrocortisone did not result in lower 90-day mortality than placebo among patients with septic shock. This effect did not differ in any of the six prespecified subgroups. We observed a more rapid resolution of shock and a lower incidence of blood transfusion among patients who received hydrocortisone than among those who received placebo. Patients who had been assigned to receive hydrocortisone had a shorter time to ICU discharge and earlier cessation of the initial episode of mechanical ventilation than did those who had been assigned to receive placebo. There were no significant between-group differences with respect to mortality at 28 days, the rate of recurrence of shock, the number of days alive and out of the ICU or hospital, the duration and rate of recurrence of mechanical ventilation, the rate of use of renal-replacement therapy, or the rate of new-onset bacteremia or fungemia. Patients who had been assigned to receive hydrocortisone had more adverse events than did those who had been assigned to receive placebo, but these events did not affect patient-centered outcomes.\nOur pragmatic trial was designed with statistical power to detect a clinically plausible effect on mortality. To reduce bias, we used a central randomization process and ensured the concealment and blinding of trial-group assignments, which were independently verified. We published our statistical analysis plan before unblinding.\nWe chose 90-day mortality as a patient-centered primary outcome and specifically targeted a population of patients who had high requirements for vital organ support (use of mechanical ventilation and ≥4 hours of vasopressor therapy before randomization) and a substantial risk of death. The trial was successful in enrolling the intended population.\nA high proportion of eligible patients received the trial intervention as planned, and few enrolled patients were lost to follow-up. The ratio of patients who underwent randomization to those who were eligible for inclusion was high: 0.69:1, a ratio that approaches that seen in other large-scale trials.29 The inclusion of 69 sites in five countries increases the external validity of the results.\nOur trial differs from previously published trials in several respects.10,11 We administered hydrocortisone by means of continuous infusion, because such a plan has been shown to attenuate the inflammatory response and reverse shock.30 Practice guidelines for septic shock suggest that infusions may minimize potentially harmful metabolic effects of glucocorticoids.15,31 A tapering strategy was not used for the discontinuation of glucocorticoids, because a beneficial effect of these agents on survival was previously reported without tapering.10 A recent study that compared abrupt cessation with a tapering strategy showed no benefits from tapering.32 We did not perform corticotropin testing, because its interpretation in critically ill patients is controversial33-35 and such testing is not recommended in current clinical practice guidelines.15 We excluded patients who had received etomidate before randomization. We did not administer fludrocortisone, because it\n######################\nOutput:"

After adjustment for multiple comparisons, there was no significant between-group difference in the number of days alive and out of the ICU (P=0.047; threshold level for significance after adjustment for multiple comparisons, P=0.005) (Table 2, and Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nPatients in the hydrocortisone group had a shorter duration of the initial episode of mechanical ventilation than did those in the placebo group (median, 6 days [interquartile range, 3 to 18] vs. 7 days [interquartile range, 3 to 24]; hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.22; P<0.001), but taking into account episodes of recurrence of ventilation, there were no significant differences in the number of days alive and free from mechanical ventilation (Table 2, and Fig. S6G and S6H in the Supplementary Appendix).\nThere were no significant between-group differences with respect to the rate of recurrence of shock, the time to hospital discharge, the number of days alive and out of hospital, the rate of recurrence of mechanical ventilation, the duration and rate of use of renal-replacement therapy, and the rate of development of new-onset bacteremia or fungemia (Table 2, and Fig. S6E and S6F in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFewer patients in the hydrocortisone group than in the placebo group received a blood transfusion (37.0% vs. 41.7%; odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94; P=0.004). Among the patients who received a transfusion, there was no significant between-group difference with respect to the mean total volume of blood transfused (Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nAdverse Events\nA total of 33 adverse events was reported in the trial population, with a higher percentage in the hydrocortisone group than in the placebo group (1.1% vs. 0.3%, P=0.009). There were 6 serious adverse events, with 4 occurring in the hydrocortisone group and 2 in the placebo group (Table 3). The list of protocol violations and the results of the interim analyses are presented in Tables S12 and S13, respectively, in the Supplementary Appendix.\nTable 3\n\nAdverse Events.\nDiscussion\nWe found that the administration of hydrocortisone did not result in lower 90-day mortality than placebo among patients with septic shock. This effect did not differ in any of the six prespecified subgroups. We observed a more rapid resolution of shock and a lower incidence of blood transfusion among patients who received hydrocortisone than among those who received placebo. Patients who had been assigned to receive hydrocortisone had a shorter time to ICU discharge and earlier cessation of the initial episode of mechanical ventilation than did those who had been assigned to receive placebo. There were no significant between-group differences with respect to mortality at 28 days, the rate of recurrence of shock, the number of days alive and out of the ICU or hospital, the duration and rate of recurrence of mechanical ventilation, the rate of use of renal-replacement therapy, or the rate of new-onset bacteremia or fungemia. Patients who had been assigned to receive hydrocortisone had more adverse events than did those who had been assigned to receive placebo, but these events did not affect patient-centered outcomes.\nOur pragmatic trial was designed with statistical power to detect a clinically plausible effect on mortality. To reduce bias, we used a central randomization process and ensured the concealment and blinding of trial-group assignments, which were independently verified. We published our statistical analysis plan before unblinding.\nWe chose 90-day mortality as a patient-centered primary outcome and specifically targeted a population of patients who had high requirements for vital organ support (use of mechanical ventilation and ≥4 hours of vasopressor therapy before randomization) and a substantial risk of death. The trial was successful in enrolling the intended population.\nA high proportion of eligible patients received the trial intervention as planned, and few enrolled patients were lost to follow-up. The ratio of patients who underwent randomization to those who were eligible for inclusion was high: 0.69:1, a ratio that approaches that seen in other large-scale trials.29 The inclusion of 69 sites in five countries increases the external validity of the results.\nOur trial differs from previously published trials in several respects.10,11 We administered hydrocortisone by means of continuous infusion, because such a plan has been shown to attenuate the inflammatory response and reverse shock.30 Practice guidelines for septic shock suggest that infusions may minimize potentially harmful metabolic effects of glucocorticoids.15,31 A tapering strategy was not used for the discontinuation of glucocorticoids, because a beneficial effect of these agents on survival was previously reported without tapering.10 A recent study that compared abrupt cessation with a tapering strategy showed no benefits from tapering.32 We did not perform corticotropin testing, because its interpretation in critically ill patients is controversial33-35 and such testing is not recommended in current clinical practice guidelines.15 We excluded patients who had received etomidate before randomization. We did not administer fludrocortisone, because it"

The trial was completed on December 23, 2015 (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Table 1 shows the primary baseline characteristics of the patients. (See also Tables S1 through S7 in the Supplementary Appendix.) Patient demographic data, severity-of-illness scores, characteristics of infection, and treatments at baseline were similar in the two groups. Most patients were admitted from a medical ward and had severe septic shock, as evidenced by high Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) values (range, 0 to 163, with higher scores indicating greater severity of illness), high lactate levels, and a high degree of vasopressor dependency (mean dose of norepinephrine, 1 μg per kilogram per minute). Most patients had community-acquired infection, and the lung was the most common site of infection. The initial antimicrobial treatment was judged adequate (by the steering committee, according to the site of infection and the sensitivity of the pathogens) in 96.2% of the patients who received placebo and 96.9% of those who received corticosteroids (Tables S2, S5, and S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 1\n\nBaseline Characteristics of the Patients.\nOutcomes\n90-Day All-Cause Mortality\nAt day 90, death had occurred in 264 of 614 patients (43.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 39.0 to 47.0) in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group and in 308 of 627 patients (49.1%; 95% CI, 45.1 to 53.1) in the placebo group (P=0.03) (Table 2 and Figure 1). The relative risk of death was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.99) in favor of hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone therapy.\nFigure 1\n\n90-Day Survival Distributions.\nTable 2\n\nTrial Outcomes.\nSecondary Outcomes\nMortality was significantly lower in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group than in the placebo group at ICU discharge (35.4% [217 of 613 patients] vs. 41.0% [257 of 627 patients], P=0.04), hospital discharge (39.0% [239 of 613 patients] vs. 45.3% [284 of 627 patients], P=0.02), and day 180 (46.6% [285 of 611 patients] vs. 52.5% [328 of 625 patients], P=0.04) (Table 2, and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group had a significantly shorter time than those in the placebo group to weaning from mechanical ventilation (P=0.006), to weaning from vasopressor therapy (P<0.001), and to reaching a SOFA score below 6 (P<0.001) (Figure 2, and Figs. S3 through S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Similarly, patients in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group had significantly more vasopressor-free days to day 28 than those in the placebo group (P<0.001) and significantly more organ-failure–free days to day 28 (P=0.003) (Table 2, and Tables S8 and S9 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nTime to Weaning from Vasopressors, to Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation, and to Reaching a SOFA Score below 6.\nSerious Adverse Events\nA total of 326 of 614 patients (53.1%) in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group and 363 of 626 patients (58.0%) in the placebo group had at least one serious adverse event by day 180 (P=0.08) (Table 3). The risk of gastroduodenal bleeding was not significantly higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo (relative risk, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.34; P=0.56), nor was the risk of superinfection (relative risk, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.30; P=0.30). However, the risk of hyperglycemia was significantly higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone (relative risk, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.12; P=0.002).\nTable 3\n\nAdverse Events.\nDiscussion\nIn this trial involving adults with septic shock, all-cause mortality was lower with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo at day 90, at discharge from the ICU and hospital, and at day 180. The time to weaning from vasopressors, to weaning from mechanical ventilation, and to reaching a SOFA score below 6 was shorter with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo. The number of days alive and free of vasopressors and organ failure was higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo. The risk of secondary infections, gastroduodenal bleeding, or neurologic sequelae was not significantly higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo, but the risk\n######################\nOutput:"

Table 1 shows the primary baseline characteristics of the patients. (See also Tables S1 through S7 in the Supplementary Appendix.) Patient demographic data, severity-of-illness scores, characteristics of infection, and treatments at baseline were similar in the two groups. Most patients were admitted from a medical ward and had severe septic shock, as evidenced by high Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) values (range, 0 to 163, with higher scores indicating greater severity of illness), high lactate levels, and a high degree of vasopressor dependency (mean dose of norepinephrine, 1 μg per kilogram per minute). Most patients had community-acquired infection, and the lung was the most common site of infection. The initial antimicrobial treatment was judged adequate (by the steering committee, according to the site of infection and the sensitivity of the pathogens) in 96.2% of the patients who received placebo and 96.9% of those who received corticosteroids (Tables S2, S5, and S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 1\n\nBaseline Characteristics of the Patients.\nOutcomes\n90-Day All-Cause Mortality\nAt day 90, death had occurred in 264 of 614 patients (43.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 39.0 to 47.0) in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group and in 308 of 627 patients (49.1%; 95% CI, 45.1 to 53.1) in the placebo group (P=0.03) (Table 2 and Figure 1). The relative risk of death was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.99) in favor of hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone therapy.\nFigure 1\n\n90-Day Survival Distributions.\nTable 2\n\nTrial Outcomes.\nSecondary Outcomes\nMortality was significantly lower in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group than in the placebo group at ICU discharge (35.4% [217 of 613 patients] vs. 41.0% [257 of 627 patients], P=0.04), hospital discharge (39.0% [239 of 613 patients] vs. 45.3% [284 of 627 patients], P=0.02), and day 180 (46.6% [285 of 611 patients] vs. 52.5% [328 of 625 patients], P=0.04) (Table 2, and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group had a significantly shorter time than those in the placebo group to weaning from mechanical ventilation (P=0.006), to weaning from vasopressor therapy (P<0.001), and to reaching a SOFA score below 6 (P<0.001) (Figure 2, and Figs. S3 through S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Similarly, patients in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group had significantly more vasopressor-free days to day 28 than those in the placebo group (P<0.001) and significantly more organ-failure–free days to day 28 (P=0.003) (Table 2, and Tables S8 and S9 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nTime to Weaning from Vasopressors, to Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation, and to Reaching a SOFA Score below 6.\nSerious Adverse Events\nA total of 326 of 614 patients (53.1%) in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group and 363 of 626 patients (58.0%) in the placebo group had at least one serious adverse event by day 180 (P=0.08) (Table 3). The risk of gastroduodenal bleeding was not significantly higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo (relative risk, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.34; P=0.56), nor was the risk of superinfection (relative risk, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.30; P=0.30). However, the risk of hyperglycemia was significantly higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone (relative risk, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.12; P=0.002).\nTable 3\n\nAdverse Events.\nDiscussion\nIn this trial involving adults with septic shock, all-cause mortality was lower with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo at day 90, at discharge from the ICU and hospital, and at day 180. The time to weaning from vasopressors, to weaning from mechanical ventilation, and to reaching a SOFA score below 6 was shorter with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo. The number of days alive and free of vasopressors and organ failure was higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo. The risk of secondary infections, gastroduodenal bleeding, or neurologic sequelae was not significantly higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo, but the risk"

An independent ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes d’Ile de France XI, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) approved the trial protocol. Participants or their legally authorized next of kin provided written informed consent before inclusion whenever possible. Otherwise, deferred written informed consent was obtained from patients.\nThis investigator-led trial was publicly funded. Our placebo-controlled trial, conducted with four parallel groups that were organized in a 2-by-2 factorial design, aimed to evaluate the benefits and risks of corticosteroids and drotrecogin alfa (activated) given alone or in combination. After the withdrawal of Xigris from the market in October 2011, the trial continued with two parallel groups. The effects of drotrecogin alfa (activated) have been reported previously14; in the current article, we report on the effects of hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone therapy. All the authors had full and independent access to all data and vouch for the integrity, accuracy, and completeness of the data and analysis and for the adherence of the trial to the protocol.\nTrial Patients\nPatients in intensive care units (ICUs) were eligible for inclusion in the trial if they had indisputable or probable septic shock15 for less than 24 hours. Septic shock was defined as the presence of a clinically or microbiologically documented infection, a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)16 score of 3 or 4 (on a scale of 0 to 4 for each of six organ systems, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction) for at least two organs and at least 6 hours, and receipt of vasopressor therapy (norepinephrine, epinephrine, or any other vasopressor at a dose of ≥0.25 μg per kilogram of body weight per minute or ≥1 mg per hour) for at least 6 hours to maintain a systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg or a mean blood pressure of at least 65 mm Hg.\nThe exclusion criteria have been detailed elsewhere.13 (See also the trial protocol.) Major exclusion criteria were the presence of septic shock for at least 24 hours, a high risk of bleeding, pregnancy or lactation, underlying conditions that could affect short-term survival, known hypersensitivity to drotrecogin alfa (activated), or previous treatment with corticosteroids. After the withdrawal of Xigris from the market, the exclusion criteria that were relevant only to drotrecogin alfa (activated) were removed.13 (Protocol amendments are detailed in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.)\nRandomization and Trial Agents\nPatients were randomly assigned in permuted blocks of eight to receive hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone therapy, drotrecogin alfa (activated), the combination of the three drugs, or their respective placebos. (For more details on randomization, see the protocol.) Hydrocortisone was administered as a 50-mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours, and fludrocortisone was given as a 50-μg tablet through a nasogastric tube once daily in the morning. Trial agents were administered for 7 days without tapering. Placebos of French commercial forms of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were manufactured for the requirements of the trial. Active agents and placebos had similar appearances (checked and certified by qualified persons for each batch) — that is, vials of white, freeze-dried powder for parenteral use of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate (100 mg) or placebo (mannitol [133.6 mg], disodium phosphate [8.73 mg], and sodium phosphate [0.92 mg]) and tablets of oral fludrocortisone or placebo (microcrystalline cellulose [59.098 mg], magnesium stearate [0.6 mg], and colloidal anhydrous silica [0.3 mg]) in blister packs of 10. The details of administration of drotrecogin alfa (activated) are available in the protocol.\nTrial Measurements and Procedures\nBefore randomization, plasma total cortisol levels were measured before, and 30 and 60 minutes after, an intravenous bolus of 250 μg of corticotropin (Synacthen). The variables that were investigated at baseline and during the 180-day follow-up have been detailed elsewhere.13 Nonexperimental interventions were harmonized across centers according to the 2008 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines,17 including antiinfective treatments, hemodynamic and respiratory management, and blood glucose control. Investigators followed national guidelines for the prevention of superinfection.18 Neuromuscular-blocking agents were discouraged except in the first 24 hours in the presence of refractory hypoxemia. Investigators’ adherence to guidelines was checked at each investigators’ meeting.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at ICU discharge, hospital discharge, day 28, and day 180; the percentage of patients from whom care was withheld or withdrawn; the percentage of\n######################\nOutput:"

Septic shock was defined as the presence of a clinically or microbiologically documented infection, a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)16 score of 3 or 4 (on a scale of 0 to 4 for each of six organ systems, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction) for at least two organs and at least 6 hours, and receipt of vasopressor therapy (norepinephrine, epinephrine, or any other vasopressor at a dose of ≥0.25 μg per kilogram of body weight per minute or ≥1 mg per hour) for at least 6 hours to maintain a systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg or a mean blood pressure of at least 65 mm Hg.\nThe exclusion criteria have been detailed elsewhere.13 (See also the trial protocol.) Major exclusion criteria were the presence of septic shock for at least 24 hours, a high risk of bleeding, pregnancy or lactation, underlying conditions that could affect short-term survival, known hypersensitivity to drotrecogin alfa (activated), or previous treatment with corticosteroids. After the withdrawal of Xigris from the market, the exclusion criteria that were relevant only to drotrecogin alfa (activated) were removed.13 (Protocol amendments are detailed in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.)\nRandomization and Trial Agents\nPatients were randomly assigned in permuted blocks of eight to receive hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone therapy, drotrecogin alfa (activated), the combination of the three drugs, or their respective placebos. (For more details on randomization, see the protocol.) Hydrocortisone was administered as a 50-mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours, and fludrocortisone was given as a 50-μg tablet through a nasogastric tube once daily in the morning. Trial agents were administered for 7 days without tapering. Placebos of French commercial forms of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were manufactured for the requirements of the trial. Active agents and placebos had similar appearances (checked and certified by qualified persons for each batch) — that is, vials of white, freeze-dried powder for parenteral use of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate (100 mg) or placebo (mannitol [133.6 mg], disodium phosphate [8.73 mg], and sodium phosphate [0.92 mg]) and tablets of oral fludrocortisone or placebo (microcrystalline cellulose [59.098 mg], magnesium stearate [0.6 mg], and colloidal anhydrous silica [0.3 mg]) in blister packs of 10. The details of administration of drotrecogin alfa (activated) are available in the protocol.\nTrial Measurements and Procedures\nBefore randomization, plasma total cortisol levels were measured before, and 30 and 60 minutes after, an intravenous bolus of 250 μg of corticotropin (Synacthen). The variables that were investigated at baseline and during the 180-day follow-up have been detailed elsewhere.13 Nonexperimental interventions were harmonized across centers according to the 2008 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines,17 including antiinfective treatments, hemodynamic and respiratory management, and blood glucose control. Investigators followed national guidelines for the prevention of superinfection.18 Neuromuscular-blocking agents were discouraged except in the first 24 hours in the presence of refractory hypoxemia. Investigators’ adherence to guidelines was checked at each investigators’ meeting.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at ICU discharge, hospital discharge, day 28, and day 180; the percentage of patients from whom care was withheld or withdrawn; the percentage of"

Secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality; days alive and free of organ dysfunction during the first 28 days according to the Brussels criteria16 (see the Supplementary Appendix); days alive and free of vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation, or renal replacement therapy; days alive and free of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, defined as freedom from two or more of the four diagnostic criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome; days alive and free of corticosteroid use; and length of stay in the ICU and hospital. We also evaluated rates of serious adverse events.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe calculated that 776 patients were required for enrollment, randomization, and receipt of the study drug in order to detect an absolute 10% difference in mortality, assuming a mortality rate of 60% in the norepinephrine group and a two-sided alpha error of 0.05 and a power of 80%. An independent data and safety monitoring committee evaluated two preplanned interim analyses, after 194 patients had been enrolled and after 388 patients had been enrolled. An O'Brien–Fleming approach was used for sequential stopping rules for safety and efficacy according to the Lan–DeMets method.17 After both interim analyses, the data and safety monitoring committee recommended that the study be continued without protocol modification.\nMidway through the trial, the executive committee, unaware of all data and in conference with the data and safety monitoring committee, determined that patients who had undergone randomization but had never received an infusion would not be included in the primary analysis, since their omission would be equally distributed between groups, would be unrelated to treatment assignment, and would not bias outcome ascertainment.18 We increased the total number of patients enrolled to maintain the target sample size after the removal of such patients from the analysis.\nThe primary analysis, which compared 28-day mortality between the two treatment groups, was performed with the use of an unadjusted chi-square test, and all patients were assessed according to the treatment received and to the treatment group assigned at randomization. Results are presented as absolute and relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Kaplan–Meier curves for the estimated probability of survival in the two treatment groups as a function of time from enrollment in the study were compared with the use of the log-rank test.\nBecause of the complex nature of septic shock and to account for any imbalances between the two treatment groups at baseline, a logistic-regression procedure and significant covariates that predicted outcomes were used to adjust raw values for 28-day mortality. Age, illness severity (score on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE II] at baseline), serious coexisting conditions, and other baseline covariates that predicted outcome (at a threshold P value of 0.20) were entered into the model. Results are presented as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We used parametric procedures (independent t-test), nonparametric procedures (Wilcoxon rank-sum test), or Fisher's exact test to compare all secondary outcomes.\nPatients were also assessed according to the a priori strata of more severe or less severe septic shock (as defined by the dose of norepinephrine) as well as in several exploratory analyses of shock severity defined by post hoc criteria. The treatment effect within each subgroup was assessed according to the within-stratum analysis, with the use of the chi-square test. We also used logistic-regression analysis to test for an interaction between stratum and treatment in order to determine whether there was a differential effect on mortality.\nThe data analyst and investigators remained unaware of the treatment assignments while undertaking the final analyses. Analysis was conducted with the use of SAS software (version 9.1.3), and all P values were two-sided.\nResults\nOf 6229 screened patients, 802 underwent randomization after providing informed consent (Figure 1). Of these 802 patients, 2 withdrew consent after infusion of the study drug and 21 did not receive the infusion for various reasons. In addition, one patient was lost to follow-up before day 28. Thus 779 patients underwent randomization and infusion of the study drug, and 778 were included in the final primary analysis: 396 in the vasopressin group and 382 in the norepinephrine group (Figure 1). The baseline characteristics of the two groups are shown in Table 1. Enrolled patients were severely ill, as indicated by the APACHE II scores,19 by the proportion with new organ dysfunction, by the serum lactate levels, and by the norepinephrine infusion rates at study entry.\nFigure 1\n\nEnrollment and Outcomes.\nTable 1\n\nDemographic and Baseline Characteristics of the Patients.\nBlood pressure in the two treatment groups was similar throughout the study, whereas the heart rate was significantly lower in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group during the first 4 days of treatment (P<0.001) (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The difference in the mean infusion rates of the study drug between treatment groups during the first 5 days was within 2 ml per hour. The rate of norepinephrine infusion was significantly lower in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group during the first 4 days (P<0.001) (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nThere was no significant difference in the primary outcome (rate of death from any cause, assessed 28 days after the start of infusions), between the vasopressin group and the norepinephrine group (35.4% and 39.3%, respectively; P=0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] for absolute risk reduction in the\n######################\nOutput:"

Patients, research staff members, and members of the safety and writing committees were unaware of the study-group assignments.\nStudy Oversight\nThe data and safety monitoring committee oversaw the trial conduct and the safety of the patients, with interim analyses performed after the inclusion of 200, 400, and 600 patients. Data were collected by the investigators and analyzed by the data-management committee. The steering committee vouches for the accuracy of the data, the completeness of the analysis, and the fidelity of the study to the protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Members of the steering committee made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The writing committee (the first author and the last three authors) had full access to all the data and collaborated with all the investigators in the writing of the manuscript. All the drugs used in the study were purchased from the manufacturers, which had no role in the study.\nStudy Patients\nPatients older than 18 years of age were enrolled if they had septic shock that was refractory to fluid resuscitation, if they required vasopressors (norepinephrine or epinephrine) at a minimum infusion rate of 0.1 μg per kilogram per minute, and if they were evaluated within 6 hours after the initiation of vasopressors. Refractoriness to fluid resuscitation was defined as a lack of response to the administration of 30 ml of normal saline per kilogram of body weight or of colloids or was determined according to a clinician's assessment of inadequate hemodynamic results on the basis of values obtained during right-heart catheterization, pulse-pressure measurement, stroke-volume measurement, or echocardiography (although study investigators did not record the values for these variables). Septic shock was defined by the presence of two or more diagnostic criteria of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, proven or suspected infection, and sudden dysfunction of at least one organ.12 Exclusion criteria were legal protection (i.e., incompetence to provide consent and no guardian or incarceration), no affiliation with the French health care system, pregnancy, recent participation in another biomedical study or another interventional study with mortality as the primary end point, or an investigator's decision not to resuscitate.\nStudy Treatments\nFluid resuscitation was performed as recommended by the French intensive care societies,13 with norepinephrine administered as a first-line vasopressor, except at one center, in which epinephrine was used. The use of activated protein C and hydrocortisone was left to the discretion of the attending physician, and the following treatments were prohibited: the use of diuretics, except for compelling indications, such as hypoxemia attributed to symptomatic sodium and water overload or life-threatening hyperkalemia; the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs; the use of iodinated contrast agents unless necessary for imaging; and the use of nephrotoxic antibiotics unless judged necessary by the attending physician. Any use of the above-mentioned drugs after study entrance was recorded.\nRenal-replacement therapy was initiated if at least one of the following criteria was present: anuria, hyperkalemia with electrocardiographic changes, pure metabolic acidosis with a pH of less than 7.2, or a blood urea nitrogen level of more than 84 mg per deciliter (30 mmol per liter) or a creatinine level of more than 5.65 mg per deciliter (499 μmol per liter). Administration of sedative and analgesic drugs or muscle relaxants was left to the discretion of the clinician; doses were reassessed at least daily to achieve values ranging from −3 to 0 on the Richmond Agitation–Sedation Scale (which ranges from −5 to 4, with lower scores indicating deeper sedation, 0 indicating a calm and responsive patient, and higher scores indicating increasing agitation); all doses of sedative and analgesic drugs were recorded daily.\nAfter enrollment, patients were assigned to vasopressor treatment that was adjusted to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 80 to 85 mm Hg (high-target group) or 65 to 70 mm Hg (low-target group). The target mean arterial pressure was to be maintained for a maximum of 5 days or until the patient was weaned from vasopressor support; after that, the target pressure was determined by the attending physician. For patients in whom the assigned target pressure was not reached despite the administration of increasing doses of vasopressors, group assignments were not modified, and data analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. (The vasopressor-weaning strategy is described in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.)\nIn the high-target group, a reduction in vasopressor doses to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 to 70 mm Hg was recommended if any of the prespecified serious adverse events that were potentially related to an increased rate of vasopressor infusion occurred. These events were as follows: clinically relevant bleeding (i.e., transfusion requirements of at least 2 units of packed red cells), myocardial infarction (defined as typical electrocardiographic changes, with a concomitant increase in troponin, and segmental echocardiographic hypokinesia or akinesia, with the infarction confirmed, when possible, by means of coronary angiography), major ventricular arrhythmia, poorly tolerated supraventricular arrhythmia, mesenteric ischemia, and distal-limb ischemia. Data analysis for serious adverse events was performed for all patients on an intention\n######################\nOutput:"

The number of days alive and free of vasopressors and organ failure was higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo. The risk of secondary infections, gastroduodenal bleeding, or neurologic sequelae was not significantly higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo, but the risk of hyperglycemia was significantly higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone. There was some imbalance between the two groups in the distribution of pathogens, with slightly more viral infections in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group than in the placebo group.\nThe mechanisms by which corticosteroids may favorably affect the outcome of patients with septic shock have been detailed recently.7 In brief, corticosteroids improve cardiovascular function by restoring effective blood volume through increased mineralocorticoid activity and by increasing systemic vascular resistance, an effect that is partly related to endothelial glucocorticoid receptors.20 This might explain why in our trial there was less need for vasopressors with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo. Corticosteroids attenuate inflammation in various organs in both animals and humans with sepsis, an effect partly related to inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB).21 In our trial, hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone therapy accelerated the resolution of organ failure in adults with septic shock.\nWith respect to 90-day all-cause mortality, there was an absolute difference of 6 percentage points and a relative difference of 12% that favored hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone over placebo; these findings are in keeping with those of a recent Cochrane review.8 In this systematic review, only 2 of 33 trials were powered to address the effects of a long (≥5 days) course of low-dose corticosteroids on mortality.8 The first trial (Ger-Inf-05), in which patients received hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone or matching placebos for 7 days, showed an absolute difference of 6 percentage points in 28-day mortality in favor of hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone.11 The second trial (Corticosteroid Therapy of Septic Shock [CORTICUS]) showed no significant survival benefit from an 11-day course of hydrocortisone alone.12 In a more recent trial involving 380 adults with severe sepsis (Hydrocortisone for Prevention of Septic Shock [HYPRESS]),22 hydrocortisone alone failed to prevent septic shock. That trial was not powered to address the effects of hydrocortisone on mortality and excluded patients with shock.\nThere are two main differences between trials that showed a survival benefit from corticosteroid therapy (APROCCHSS and Ger-Inf-05) and those that did not (CORTICUS and HYPRESS). First, in the APROCCHSS and Ger-Inf-05 trials, fludrocortisone was added to hydrocortisone to provide additional mineralocorticoid potency. It was administered enterally in the absence of an intravenous formulation of this drug. The rationale for adding mineralocorticoid treatment is that an experimental sepsis study showed marked NF-κB–mediated down-regulation of vascular mineralocorticoid receptors.23 Treatment with aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid-receptor agonist, restored α1-adrenoceptor expression, improved contractile response to phenylephrine, and improved survival in mice with endotoxic shock. In a recent pharmacokinetic study involving adults with septic shock, enteral administration of 50 μg of fludrocortisone resulted in plasma concentrations of the drug that exerted significant mineralocorticoid effects, with some interindividual variability.24\nSecond, the APROCCHSS and Ger-Inf-05 trials focused on patients with septic shock whose condition did not improve after initial resuscitation according to the 6-hour bundle of care outlined in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines.17 For these patients, norepinephrine at a dose of more than 0.25 μg per kilogram per minute for more than 6 hours was required in order for hemodynamic stabilization to be achieved. This group of patients was selected because they may be at high risk for death, which makes them the best target group for adjunct therapy.15 The crude in-hospital mortality of 45.3% that was observed in the placebo group of the APROCCHSS trial is close to that reported by the Sepsis-3 task force.1,2 Patients in the APROCCHSS trial were sicker than those in the CORTICUS trial, as evidenced by higher SOFA scores (by approximately 1.5 points) and higher SAPS II values (by approximately 7 points), and were more likely to be admitted from medical wards. Hence, the Ger-Inf-05 and APROCCHSS trials independently showed a survival benefit with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone in adults with septic shock and persistent vasopressor dependency and organ failures.\nAlthough this trial could not assess the potential interaction between drotrecogin alfa (activated) and corticosteroids, this question is no longer relevant since the withdrawal of Xigris from the market in 2011.

Consistent with at least 14 previous trials in humans10–14,20–28 of low-dose vasopressin (≤0.1 U per minute), vasopressin infusion allowed a rapid decrease in the total norepinephrine dose while maintaining mean arterial pressure.10–12,29\nOur study was prospectively powered to detect an absolute difference in mortality of 10% from an expected 60%. However, the observed mortality rates in both the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups were considerably lower than those in previous studies, perhaps because of overall improvements in the care of patients who have septic shock. Nonetheless, our data exclude with 95% confidence a harm associated with the use of vasopressin that was greater than 2.9% or a benefit that was greater than 10.7%.\nThe overall rates of serious adverse events were approximately 10% each in the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups. Previous studies raised the possibility that vasopressin infusion may increase the incidence of cardiac arrest.29 In contrast, we found that of 11 cardiac arrests reported in this study, 8 occurred in the norepinephrine group and 3 occurred in the vasopressin group. Our selection of a low dose of vasopressin (0.03 U per minute) and careful exclusion of patients who had acute coronary syndromes or severe heart failure could account for the lack of adverse cardiovascular effects of vasopressin infusion. If vasopressin becomes routine therapy and is given at higher doses or to patients with septic shock who have coexisting heart disease, the adverse reactions to vasopressin could be increased. Other reported adverse effects of vasopressin and norepinephrine include decreased cardiac output,11,14,29 mesenteric ischemia,21,30 hyponatremia (with vasopressin only), skin necrosis,31 and digital ischemia.32 More patients in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group had digital ischemia; one patient in the vasopressin group required surgical intervention.\nOur secondary hypothesis was that the beneficial effects of vasopressin as compared with norepinephrine would be more pronounced in the subgroup of patients with more severe septic shock. No significant interaction between treatment group and shock-severity subgroup (as defined a priori) was shown. Some of the analyses we performed suggested that vasopressin may be more beneficial in patients with less severe septic shock. However, the statistical significance of these observations is uncertain, especially because of the many statistical tests performed, and this finding should be considered only as a hypothesis-generating concept to be tested in future trials.33\nSeveral limitations of our trial should be mentioned. The vasopressin was infused over a set range of doses, and we did not measure vasopressin levels as a guide to the dose or the duration of infusion. In addition, in this trial the mean arterial pressure at baseline was 72 to 73 mm Hg, essentially making this a study of the effects of low-dose vasopressin as a “catecholamine-sparing drug,” not an evaluation of vasopressin in patients with catecholamine-unresponsive refractory shock. The mean time from meeting the criteria for study entry to infusion of the study drug (12 hours) was greater than the period that Rivers and colleagues4 identified as being important in early goal-directed therapy (6 hours), which may be one reason that we did not find a benefit of vasopressin as compared with norepinephrine.\nIn summary, we evaluated the effect of low-dose vasopressin (0.03 U per minute) when used in conjunction with catecholamine vasopressors in patients with septic shock. We did not find a significant reduction in mortality rates with vasopressin.\n######################\nOutput:"

These analyses showed that among patients with a systolic blood pressure persisting at less than 90 mm Hg within 30 hours after study entry, 31 of 69 patients in the hydrocortisone group (44.9%) and 32 of 57 patients in the placebo group (56.1%) had died, with an absolute difference in the hydrocortisone group of –11.2% (95% CI, –18.6 to 6.2; P=0.28); among those whose systolic blood pressure was measured at 90 mm Hg or more within 30 hours after study entry, 55 of 181 in the hydrocortisone group (30.4%) and 46 of 189 in the placebo group (24.3%) died, with an absolute difference in the hydrocortisone group of 6.1% (95% CI, −3.0 to 15.1; P=0.20). In post hoc analyses, the rates of death among the 384 patients who received a study drug within 12 hours after baseline were similar in the two groups: 73 of 198 patients in the hydrocortisone group (36.9%) and 58 of 186 patients in the placebo group (31.2%, P=0.28) (Table 3 of the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan–Meier Curves for Survival at 28 Days.\nTable 3\n\nOutcomes According to Subgroup.\nPost hoc analyses also revealed an increased rate of death at 28 days among patients who received etomidate before randomization in both groups (23 of 51 in the hydrocortisone group [45.1%] and 18 of 45 in the placebo group [40.0%]), as compared with patients who did not receive etomidate (63 of 200 in the hydrocortisone group [31.5%] and 60 of 203 in the placebo group [29.6%, P=0.03]).\nReversal of Shock\nThe proportions of patients who underwent a reversal of shock were similar among patients who did not have a response to corticotropin: 95 of 125 in the hydrocortisone group (76.0%; 95% CI, 68.5 to 83.5) and 76 of 108 in the placebo group (70.4%; 95% CI, 61.8 to 79.0; P=0.41); among patients who had a response to corticotropin: 100 of 118 patients in the hydrocortisone group (84.7%; 95% CI, 78.3 to 91.2) and 104 of 136 in the placebo group (76.5%; 95% CI, 69.3 to 83.6; P=0.13); and among all patients: 200 of 251 in the hydrocortisone group (79.7%; 95% CI, 74.7 to 84.7) and 184 of 248 in the placebo group (74.2%; 95% CI, 68.7 to 79.6; P=0.18).\nThe duration of time until the reversal of shock was significantly shorter among patients receiving hydrocortisone for all patients (P<0.001), for those who had a response to corticotropin (P<0.001), and for those who did not have a response to corticotropin (P=0.06) (Figure 3). The median time until reversal of shock was also shorter in the hydrocortisone group than in the placebo group: for all patients, 3.3 days (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.9) versus 5.8 days (95% CI, 5.2 to 6.9); for those who had a response to corticotropin, 2.8 days (95% CI, 2.1 to 3.3) versus 5.8 days (95% CI, 5.2 to 6.9); and for those who did not have a response, 3.9 days (95% CI, 3.0 to 5.2) versus 6.0 days (95% CI, 4.9 to 9.0).\nFigure 3\n\nKaplan–Meier Curves for the Time to Reversal of Shock.\nThe number of extubated patients on day 28 was similar in the two study groups: 119 of 228 patients who underwent ventilation at baseline in the hydrocortisone group (52%) and 113 of 212 patients in the placebo group (53%).

We hypothesized that low-dose vasopressin as compared with norepinephrine would decrease mortality among patients with septic shock who were being treated with conventional (catecholamine) vasopressors.\nMethods\nIn this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned patients who had septic shock and were receiving a minimum of 5 μg of norepinephrine per minute to receive either low-dose vasopressin (0.01 to 0.03 U per minute) or norepinephrine (5 to 15 μg per minute) in addition to open-label vasopressors. All vasopressor infusions were titrated and tapered according to protocols to maintain a target blood pressure. The primary end point was the mortality rate 28 days after the start of infusions.\nResults\nA total of 778 patients underwent randomization, were infused with the study drug (396 patients received vasopressin, and 382 norepinephrine), and were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups in the 28-day mortality rate (35.4% and 39.3%, respectively; P=0.26) or in 90-day mortality (43.9% and 49.6%, respectively; P=0.11). There were no significant differences in the overall rates of serious adverse events (10.3% and 10.5%, respectively; P=1.00). In the prospectively defined stratum of less severe septic shock, the mortality rate was lower in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group at 28 days (26.5% vs. 35.7%, P=0.05); in the stratum of more severe septic shock, there was no significant difference in 28-day mortality (44.0% and 42.5%, respectively; P=0.76). A test for heterogeneity between these two study strata was not significant (P=0.10).\nConclusions\nLow-dose vasopressin did not reduce mortality rates as compared with norepinephrine among patients with septic shock who were treated with catecholamine vasopressors. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN94845869.)\nSeptic shock is the most common cause of death in intensive care units (ICUs)1,2 and has a mortality rate of 40 to 60%. 2,3 Resuscitation strategies include the administration of intravenous fluids and the use of catecholamines such as norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, and dobutamine.4,5 Although largely effective in reestablishing minimally acceptable mean arterial pressures to maintain organ perfusion, catecholamines have important adverse effects and may even increase mortality rates.6 For example, norepinephrine, a potent and commonly used α-adrenergic agent in cases of septic shock, may decrease cardiac output, oxygen delivery, and blood flow to vulnerable organs despite adequate perfusion pressure.7\nVasopressin, an endogenously released peptide hormone, has emerged as an adjunct to catecholamines for patients who have severe septic shock. The rationale for its use is the relative vasopressin deficiency in patients with septic shock and the hypothesis that exogenously administered vasopressin can restore vascular tone and blood pressure, thereby reducing the need for the use of catecholamines.8–10 Observational studies involving the use of vasopressin infusion rates below 0.1 U per minute in patients with vasodilatory shock have repeatedly shown improved short-term blood-pressure responses.10–14 However, vasopressin infusion may decrease blood flow in the heart, kidneys, and intestine. Despite the widespread use of vasopressin in clinical practice, only two small randomized trials have evaluated its use in patients who had septic shock.10,12 Vasopressin increased blood pressure, decreased catecholamine requirements, and improved renal function as compared with a control agent. However, neither of the trials was powered to evaluate mortality, organ dysfunction, or safety.\nTo address these uncertainties, we conducted a multicenter, randomized, stratified, double-blind trial among patients who had septic shock and were receiving usual care (including catecholamines), to determine whether vasopressin decreased 28-day mortality, as compared with norepinephrine. Our secondary hypothesis was that the beneficial effects of vasopressin would be more pronounced than those of norepinephrine in the subgroup of patients with more severe (as opposed to less severe) septic shock. Therefore, we stratified patients at the time of randomization according to the baseline dose of norepinephrine.\nMethods\nThis trial was conducted between July 2001 and April 2006 in 27 centers in Canada, Australia, and the United States and was approved by the research ethics boards of all participating institutions.

We hypothesized that low-dose vasopressin as compared with norepinephrine would decrease mortality among patients with septic shock who were being treated with conventional (catecholamine) vasopressors.\nMethods\nIn this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned patients who had septic shock and were receiving a minimum of 5 μg of norepinephrine per minute to receive either low-dose vasopressin (0.01 to 0.03 U per minute) or norepinephrine (5 to 15 μg per minute) in addition to open-label vasopressors. All vasopressor infusions were titrated and tapered according to protocols to maintain a target blood pressure. The primary end point was the mortality rate 28 days after the start of infusions.\nResults\nA total of 778 patients underwent randomization, were infused with the study drug (396 patients received vasopressin, and 382 norepinephrine), and were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups in the 28-day mortality rate (35.4% and 39.3%, respectively; P=0.26) or in 90-day mortality (43.9% and 49.6%, respectively; P=0.11). There were no significant differences in the overall rates of serious adverse events (10.3% and 10.5%, respectively; P=1.00). In the prospectively defined stratum of less severe septic shock, the mortality rate was lower in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group at 28 days (26.5% vs. 35.7%, P=0.05); in the stratum of more severe septic shock, there was no significant difference in 28-day mortality (44.0% and 42.5%, respectively; P=0.76). A test for heterogeneity between these two study strata was not significant (P=0.10).\nConclusions\nLow-dose vasopressin did not reduce mortality rates as compared with norepinephrine among patients with septic shock who were treated with catecholamine vasopressors.
