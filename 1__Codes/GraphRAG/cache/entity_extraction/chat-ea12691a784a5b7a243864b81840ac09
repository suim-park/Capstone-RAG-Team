Similarly, there was no significant difference in mortality at 90 days (43.9% and 49.6%, respectively; P=0.11; 95% CI for absolute risk reduction, −1.3 to 12.8%) or in rates of organ dysfunction (Table 2). The results remained nonsignificant after multivariate logistic-regression analysis (odds ratio for death in the vasopressin group at 28 days, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.26]; odds ratio for death at 90 days, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.57 to 1.16]).\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan–Meier Survival Curves for Patients Who Underwent Randomization and Infusion.\nTable 2\n\nAnalysis of the Rates and Risks of Death from Any Cause and Secondary Outcomes.\nThere were no significant differences in the overall rates or specific categories of serious adverse events between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups (overall rates, 10.3% and 10.5%, respectively; P=1.00) (Table 3). There was a trend toward a higher rate of cardiac arrest in the norepinephrine group than in the vasopressin group (2.1% vs. 0.8%, P=0.14) and a trend toward a higher rate of digital ischemia in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group (2.0% vs. 0.5%, P=0.11).\nTable 3\n\nSerious Adverse Events in Patients Who Had Septic Shock.\nIn the subgroup of patients in whom plasma vasopressin levels were measured, the levels were extremely low at baseline (median, 3.2 pmol per liter; interquartile range, 1.7 to 4.9). These levels did not change in the norepinephrine group. Infusion of low-dose vasopressin increased vasopressin levels to medians of 73.6 pmol per liter (interquartile range, 58.6 to 94.7) at 6 hours and 98.0 pmol per liter (interquartile range, 67.1 to 127.8) at 24 hours (Fig. 3 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nBaseline characteristics of the patients in the stratum of more severe septic shock and those in the stratum of less severe septic shock are presented in the Supplementary Appendix. Among patients who had less severe septic shock (an infusion of 5 to 14 μg of norepinephrine per minute at randomization), there were trends in favor of the vasopressin group with respect to both 28-day and 90-day mortality (Table 4). In contrast, there were no significant differences in mortality between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups in the stratum of more severe septic shock. However, the test for the interaction between the treatment assignment and the severity-of-shock subgroup was not significant (P=0.10). We performed several additional post hoc analyses of the results stratified according to different indicators of illness severity (Table 3 of the Supplementary Appendix). For most of these analyses, there was no evidence of a significant interaction between illness severity and vasopressin effect. Two of the interaction analyses (stratification according to quartile of lactate level and according to number of vasopressors at baseline) yielded moderately significant P values (P=0.04 for both), suggesting a possible advantage of vasopressin in patients with less severe shock (Table 3 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 4\n\nRates and Risks of Death from Any Cause According to the Severity of Shock.\nDiscussion\nIn this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial of low-dose vasopressin as compared with norepinephrine in patients with septic shock, we were not able to demonstrate any significant difference in the 28-day mortality rate (35.4% in the vasopressin group vs. 39.3% in the norepinephrine group, P=0.26). We were also unable to demonstrate any significant difference between the two study groups in 90-day mortality or the rate of organ dysfunction. There was no difference in the rates of serious adverse events between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups. Infusions of low-dose vasopressin (0.03 U per minute) increased plasma vasopressin levels to approximately 70 to 100 pmol per liter from extremely low baseline vasopressin levels (median, 3.2 pmol per liter). Consistent with at least 14 previous trials in humans10–14,20–28 of low-dose vasopressin (≤0.1 U per minute), vasopressin infusion allowed a rapid decrease in the total norepinephrine dose while maintaining mean arterial pressure.10–12,29\nOur study was prospectively powered to detect an absolute difference in mortality of 10%\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
