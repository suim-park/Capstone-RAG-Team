During this period, the patients assigned to standard therapy had a significantly lower central venous oxygen saturation (P<0.001) and a greater base deficit (P=0.006) than those assigned to early goal-directed therapy; the two groups had similar lactate concentrations (P=0.62) and similar pH values (P=0.26).\nDuring the period from 7 to 72 hours after the start of treatment, the patients assigned to standard therapy had a significantly higher heart rate (P=0.04) and a significantly lower mean arterial pressure (P<0.001) than the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy; the two groups had a similar central venous pressure (P=0.68). During this period, those assigned to standard therapy also had a significantly lower central venous oxygen saturation than those assigned to early goal-directed therapy (P<0.001), as well as a higher lactate concentration (P=0.02), a greater base deficit (P<0.001), and a lower pH (P<0.001).\nOrgan Dysfunction and Coagulation Variables\nDuring the period from 7 to 72 hours, the APACHE II score, SAPS II, and MODS were significantly higher in the patients assigned to standard therapy than in the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy (P<0.001 for all comparisons) (Table 2). During this period, the prothrombin time was significantly greater in the patients assigned to standard therapy than in those assigned to early goal-directed therapy (P=0.001), as was the concentration of fibrin-split products (P<0.001) and the concentration of D-dimer (P=0.006). The two groups had a similar partial-thromboplastin time (P=0.06), fibrinogen concentration (P=0.21), and platelet count (P=0.51) (Table 2).\nMortality\nIn-hospital mortality rates were significantly higher in the standard-therapy group than in the early-therapy group (P=0.009), as was the mortality at 28 days (P=0.01) and 60 days (P=0.03) (Table 3). The difference between the groups in mortality at 60 days primarily reflected the difference in in-hospital mortality. Similar results were obtained after data from the 27 patients who did not complete the initial six-hour study period were excluded from the analysis (data not shown). The rate of in-hospital death due to sudden cardiovascular collapse was significantly higher in the standard-therapy group than in the early-therapy group (P=0.02); the rate of death due to multiorgan failure was similar in the two groups (P=0.27).\nTable 3\n\nKaplan–Meier Estimates of Mortality and Causes of In-Hospital Death.\nAdministered Treatments\nDuring the initial six hours, the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy received significantly more fluid than those assigned to standard therapy (P<0.001) and more frequently received red-cell transfusion (P<0.001) and inotropic support (P<0.001), whereas similar proportions of patients in the two groups required vasopressors (P=0.62) and mechanical ventilation (P=0.90) (Table 4). During the period from 7 to 72 hours, however, the patients assigned to standard therapy received significantly more fluid than those assigned to early goal-directed therapy (P=0.01) and more often received red-cell transfusion (P<0.001) and vasopressors (P=0.03) and underwent mechanical ventilation (P<0.001) and pulmonary-artery catheterization (P=0.04); the rate of use of inotropic agents was similar in the two groups (P=0.14) (Table 4). During the overall period from base line to 72 hours after the start of treatment, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the total volume of fluid administered (P=0.73) or the rate of use of inotropic agents (P=0.15), although a greater proportion of the patients assigned to standard therapy than of those assigned to early goal-directed therapy received vasopressors (P=0.02) and mechanical ventilation (P=0.02) and underwent pulmonary-artery catheterization (P=0.01), and a smaller proportion required red-cell transfusion (P<0.001). Though similar between the groups at base line (P=0.91), the mean hematocrit during this 72-hour period was significantly lower in the standard-therapy group than in the early-therapy group (P<0.001). Despite the transfusion of red cells, it was significantly lower than the value obtained at base line in each group (P<0.001 for both comparisons) (Table 2).\nTable 4\n\nTreatments Administered.\nConsumption of Health Care Resources\nThere were no significant differences between the two groups in the mean duration of vasopressor therapy (2.4±4.2 vs. 1.9±3.1 days, P=0.49), the mean duration of mechanical ventilation (9.0±13.1 vs. 9.0±11.4 days, P=0.38), or the mean length of stay in the hospital (13.0±13.7 vs. 13.2±13.8 days, P\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
