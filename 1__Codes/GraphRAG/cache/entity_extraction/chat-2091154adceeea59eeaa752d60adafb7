All analyses were conducted with the use of SAS statistical software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute). Two-sided P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance, except in the case of the primary outcome, for which a P value of 0.0379 or less was used.19\nStudy results were initially reviewed by the management committee, whose members were unaware of the study-group assignments. Post hoc analyses were performed to further evaluate the effects of the study drugs on temperature and the use of cointerventions that might have affected body temperature before the study-group assignments were unmasked. Additional details of statistical analyses and post hoc analyses are available in the Supplementary Appendix.\nResults\nPatient Characteristics\nFrom February 2013 through July 2014, we enrolled 700 patients in 23 adult medical–surgical ICUs in Australia and New Zealand, with 352 patients assigned to receive acetaminophen and 348 to receive placebo (Figure 1). Ten participants withdrew consent, resulting in an intention-to-treat population of 690, of whom 346 were assigned to receive acetaminophen and 344 were assigned to receive placebo. Data on the primary outcome were available for the entire intention-to-treat population.\nFigure 1\n\nScreening, Randomization, and Follow-up.\nThe study groups had similar characteristics at baseline (Table 1, and Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The most common sites of infection were the lungs and the abdomen. A causative organism was identified in 217 of 347 patients (62.5%) assigned to acetaminophen and in 214 of 344 patients (62.2%) assigned to placebo (Tables S4 and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\nThe median number of doses of study drug was 8 (interquartile range, 5 to 14) in the acetaminophen group and 9 (interquartile range, 6 to 15) in the placebo group (absolute difference, −1 dose; 95% confidence interval [CI], −2 to 0; P=0.15) (Fig. S2A in the Supplementary Appendix). The study drug was administered in accordance with the protocol in 281 of 347 patients (81.0%) assigned to acetaminophen and in 289 of 344 patients (84.0%) assigned to placebo. All protocol deviations are listed in Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix. The most common reasons for discontinuation of the study drug were discharge from the ICU and resolution of fever (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nOpen-label acetaminophen was administered in the ICU in 104 of 347 patients (30.0%) assigned to acetaminophen and in 101 of 344 patients (29.4%) assigned to placebo (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.19; P=0.86) and was used predominantly in the latter phases of ICU treatment (Fig. S2B and S2C in the Supplementary Appendix). There were no significant differences between study groups in the use of physical cooling or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (Fig. S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nPhysiological Effects\nPatients assigned to receive acetaminophen had a lower mean daily peak body temperature than those assigned to placebo (38.4±1.0°C vs. 38.6±0.8°C; absolute difference, −0.25°C; 95% CI, −0.38 to −0.11; P<0.001) and a lower mean daily average body temperature (37.0±0.6°C vs. 37.3±0.6°C; absolute difference, −0.28°C; 95% CI, −0.37 to −0.19; P<0.001) (Fig. S5 and S6 and Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The study drug was discontinued because of sustained resolution of fever in 79 of 347 patients (22.8%) assigned to acetaminophen and in 58 of 344 patients (16.9%) assigned to placebo (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.99 to 2.12; P=0.05). Among patients in whom the study drug was discontinued owing to discharge from the ICU, 19 of 154 patients (12.3%) assigned to acetaminophen and 37 of 161 patients (23.0%) assigned to placebo had a temperature of 38°C or higher on their last day in the ICU (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.86; P=0.01). CRP, creatinine, and creatine kinase values were similar in the two groups (Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nPrimary Outcome\nThe number of ICU-free days to day 28 did not differ significantly between the acetaminophen group and the placebo group: 23 days (interquartile range, 13 to 25) among patients assigned to acetaminophen and 22 days (interquartile range, 12 to 25) among patients assigned to placebo (absolute difference, 0 days; 96.2% CI, 0 to 1; P=0.07) (Table 2). The distribution of ICU-free days according to study group is shown in Figure S7 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nTable 2\n\nStudy Outcomes.\nSecondary Outcomes\nThere were no significant differences between the acetaminophen group and the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
