Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables, including the primary outcome. Absolute and relative risk differences with 95% confidence intervals for all-cause mortality at 90 days are reported. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed with the use of multivariable logistic regression adjusted for predefined baseline covariates: country, age, score on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), systolic blood pressure (<90 mm Hg or ≥90 mm Hg), and presence or absence of invasive mechanical ventilation. We used the Kaplan–Meier method to calculate survival time from randomization to 90 days and the log-rank test to perform between-group comparisons. We used Cox proportional-hazards models adjusted for the previously specified baseline covariates to calculate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Values for length of hospital stay and duration of organ support were log-transformed and analyzed with the use of linear regression and are reported as ratios with 95% confidence intervals.\nWe conducted subgroup analyses for the primary outcome for predefined variables: country, age (<65 years or ≥65 years), APACHE II score (<25 or ≥25), presence or absence of invasive mechanical ventilation, presence or absence or refractory hypotension, lactate level (<4.0 mmol per liter or ≥4.0 mmol per liter), and intravenous fluid administration (<20 ml per kilogram of body weight or ≥20 ml per kilogram). Subgroup analyses were performed with the use of logistic regression, with heterogeneity determined on the basis of interaction between treatment and subgroup. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for death at 90 days are presented in a forest plot.\nAll analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute). A two-sided P value of 0.05 or less was considered to indicate statistical significance, except for the primary outcome, for which a P value of 0.0491 or less was used.\nResults\nStudy Patients\nWe enrolled 1600 patients, with 796 assigned to the EGDT group and 804 to the usual-care group (Figure 1). Delayed consent was refused for 9 patients (3 in the EGDT group and 6 in the usual-care group), leaving an intention-to-treat population of 793 patients and 798 patients, respectively. By day 90, 1 patient in the usual-care group had revoked consent, and 2 patients (1 in each group) were lost to follow-up, leaving a final cohort of 1588 patients for whom the primary outcome was available: 792 (99.5%) in the EGDT group and 796 (99.0%) in the usual-care group.\nFigure 1\n\nEnrollment and Outcomes.\nDemographic and clinical characteristics at baseline were similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).31,32 The criterion for refractory hypotension was met by 555 patients (70.0%) in the EGDT group and 557 (69.8%) in the usual-case group. The criterion for an elevated lactate level was met by 365 patients (46.0%) in the EGDT group and 371 (46.5%) in the usual-care group (Table 1). There was no significant difference in the mean intravenous fluid volume that had been infused at baseline, with 2515±1244 ml (34.6±19.4 ml per kilogram) in the EGDT group and 2591±1331 ml (34.7±20.1 ml per kilogram) in the usual-care group. The median time from presentation to the emergency department until randomization was 2.8 hours (interquartile range, 2.1 to 3.9) in the EDGT group and 2.7 hours (interquartile range, 2.0 to 3.9) in the usual-care group.\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\nMicrobiologic Data\nThe median time between presentation to the emergency department and administration of the first dose of intravenous antimicrobial therapy was similar in the two groups: 70 minutes (interquartile range, 38 to 114) in the EGDT group and 67 minutes (interquartile range, 39 to 110) in the usual-care group. The lungs and urinary tract were the most common locations of infection, and blood cultures were positive in 38% of patients in each study group. The numbers of patients receiving treatment to control the source of infection up to 72 hours after randomization were 78 (9.8%) in the EGDT group and 97 (12.2%) in the usual-care group (P=0.14). Detailed microbiologic data are presented in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nInterventions and Therapies\nPatients who were admitted directly from the emergency department to the ICU numbered 690 (87.0%) in the EGDT group and 614 (76.9%) in the usual-case group (P<0.001). A central venous catheter for continuous monitoring of the ScvO2 was inserted during the first 6 hours after randomization in 714 patients (90.0%) in the EGDT group. The median time to insertion was 1.1 hours (interquartile range, 0.7 to 1.6), and the mean ScvO2 was 72.7±10.5%. A central venous catheter was inserted during the first 6 hours in 494 patients (61.9%) in the usual-care group. The median time to insertion was 1.2 hours (interquartile range, 0.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EGDT GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The EGDT group is a cohort of patients enrolled in a study to receive early goal-directed therapy, with 796 patients initially assigned and 792 completing the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The usual-care group is a cohort of patients enrolled in a study to receive standard care, with 804 patients initially assigned and 796 completing the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAS INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAS Institute is the organization that developed the SAS software used for statistical analysis in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APACHE II<|>EVENT<|>The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II is a scoring system used to assess the severity of disease in patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KAPLAN–MEIER METHOD<|>EVENT<|>The Kaplan–Meier method is a statistical measure used to estimate survival time from randomization to 90 days in the study)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT GROUP<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>Both groups were part of a study comparing early goal-directed therapy with usual care<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAS INSTITUTE<|>EGDT GROUP<|>SAS software from SAS Institute was used to analyze data from the EGDT group<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAS INSTITUTE<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>SAS software from SAS Institute was used to analyze data from the usual-care group<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APACHE II<|>EGDT GROUP<|>APACHE II scores were used as a baseline covariate in the analysis of the EGDT group<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APACHE II<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>APACHE II scores were used as a baseline covariate in the analysis of the usual-care group<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAPLAN–MEIER METHOD<|>EGDT GROUP<|>The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate survival time for the EGDT group<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAPLAN–MEIER METHOD<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate survival time for the usual-care group<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
