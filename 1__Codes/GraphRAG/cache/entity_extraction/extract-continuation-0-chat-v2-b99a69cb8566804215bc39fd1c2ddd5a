At 6 hours, values for central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, and hemoglobin were similar in the two groups among patients in whom they were measured, which happened with greater frequency in the EGDT group (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nAfter the Intervention Period\nBetween 6 and 72 hours, the numbers of patients in the two groups receiving intravenous fluids were similar, but patients in the usual-care group received larger volumes. More patients in the EGDT group received intravenous colloids, but overall volumes were similar in the two groups. The number of patients receiving intravenous crystalloids was similar in the two groups, but volumes were larger in the usual-care group. The number of patients receiving red-cell transfusions was higher in the EGDT group, but volumes were larger in the usual-care group. The use of vasopressors and dobutamine remained higher in the EGDT group. Although the numbers of patients receiving platelets and fresh-frozen plasma were similar in the two groups, the volume of platelets was larger in the EGDT group, whereas the volume of fresh-frozen plasma was higher in the usual-care group (Table 2, and Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). At 72 hours, physiological, biochemical, and SOFA values were similar in the two groups (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nPrimary Outcome\nMortality at 90 days was not significantly different in the two groups, with deaths reported in 184 of 623 patients (29.5%) in the EGDT group versus 181 of 620 patients (29.2%) in the usual-care group, with an unadjusted relative risk in the EGDT group of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.20; P=0.90), for an absolute risk reduction of −0.3 percentage points (95% CI, −5.4 to 4.7). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, the odds ratio was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.74 to 1.24; P=0.73) (Table 3). Sensitivity analyses for patients with a missing primary outcome (2 in the EGDT group and 6 in the usual-care group) showed relative risks ranging from 0.99 to 1.03. There was no evidence of a learning-curve effect (P=0.56). In the adherence-adjusted analysis, the relative risk was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.32; P=0.90) (Table S9 and Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 3\n\nStudy Outcomes.\nSecondary Outcomes\nThe mean SOFA score at 6 hours, the proportion of patients receiving advanced cardiovascular support, and the median length of stay in the ICU were significantly greater in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group. No other secondary outcomes were significantly different (Table 3, and Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). There was no significant difference in the duration of survival between the two groups (P=0.63 by the log-rank test; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.94, 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.11; P=0.46) (Figure 2). Mean EQ-5D scores and QALYs were similar in the two groups. The average cost was higher in the EGDT group (£12,414 [U.S. $17,647]) than in the usual-care group (£11,424 [U.S. $16,239]), but the difference was not significant (P=0.26) (Table 3, and Tables S11 through S16 and Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The incremental net benefit for EGDT as compared with usual care was negative and similar across prespecified subgroups and alternative scenarios that were considered in sensitivity analyses (Tables S17 and S18 and Fig. S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). The probability that EGDT was cost-effective was below 20% (Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan–Meier Survival Estimates.\nSubgroup Analyses\nThere was no significant difference regarding the effect of EGDT according to prespecified subgroups as defined by the degree of protocolized care used in the usual-care group, age, MEDS score, SOFA score, or time from presentation at the emergency department to randomization (P=0.39 to 0.72 for interaction) (Table S9 and Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nSerious Adverse Events\nAt least one serious adverse event was reported in 30 patients (4.8%) in the EGDT group and 26 patients (4.2%) in the usual-care group (P=0.58) (Table 3, and Table S19 in the Supplementary Appendix). Four serious adverse events were reported as being related to EGDT (two cases of pulmonary edema and one of arrhythmia, which were deemed to be probably related, and one case of myocardial ischemia, which was deemed to be definitely related), as compared with four events (in three patients) related to usual care (two cases of pneumothorax and one case of pulmonary edema, which were deemed to be probably related, and one case of ventricular fibrillation, which was deemed to be definitely related).\nDiscussion\nIn our study involving adults with early signs of septic shock who presented to emergency departments in England, there was no significant difference in mortality at 90 days among those receiving\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EGDT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EGDT, or Early Goal-Directed Therapy, is a treatment protocol used in the management of septic shock, focusing on optimizing hemodynamic parameters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The usual-care group refers to patients receiving standard treatment for septic shock without the specific protocol of EGDT)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENGLAND<|>GEO<|>Country where the study involving adults with early signs of septic shock was conducted)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOFA SCORE<|>EVENT<|>The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is used to track a patient's status during their stay in an intensive care unit)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>The study compared the outcomes of patients receiving EGDT with those receiving usual care<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT<|>ENGLAND<|>The study on EGDT was conducted in England<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>ENGLAND<|>The study on the usual-care group was conducted in England<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT<|>SOFA SCORE<|>The SOFA score was used to assess patients in the EGDT group<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>SOFA SCORE<|>The SOFA score was used to assess patients in the usual-care group<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
