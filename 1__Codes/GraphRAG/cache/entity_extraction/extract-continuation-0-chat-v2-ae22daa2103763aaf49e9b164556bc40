Among patients with septic shock, recombinant activated human protein C was administered in 102 patients in the dopamine group (18.8%) and 96 patients in the norepinephrine group (19.1%).\nFigure 1\n\nScreening and Enrollment.\nTable 1\n\nBaseline Characteristics of the Patients and Major Therapeutic Interventions at Baseline.\nData on hemodynamic variables and doses of vasoactive agents are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 in the Supplementary Appendix. The mean arterial pressure was similar in the two treatment groups at baseline, and it changed similarly over time, although it was slightly higher from 12 to 24 hours in the norepinephrine group. The doses of the study drug were similar in the two groups at all times. More patients in the dopamine group than in the norepinephrine group required open-label norepinephrine therapy at some point (26% vs. 20%, P<0.001), but the doses of open-label norepinephrine that were administered were similar in the two groups. The use of open-label epinephrine at any time was similar in the two groups (administered in 3.5% of patients in the dopamine group and in 2.3% of those in the norepinephrine group, P=0.10), as was the use of vasopressin (0.2% in both groups, P=0.67). Dobutamine was used more frequently in patients treated with norepinephrine, but 12 hours after randomization, the doses of dobutamine were significantly higher in patients treated with dopamine. The mean (±SD) time to the achievement of a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg was similar in the two groups (6.3±5.6 hours in the dopamine group and 6.0±4.9 hours in the norepinephrine group, P=0.35). There were no major between-group differences in the total amounts of fluid given, although patients in the dopamine group received more fluids on day 1 than did patients in the norepinephrine group. Urine output was significantly higher during the first 24 hours after randomization among patients in the dopamine group than among those in the norepinephrine group, but this difference eventually disappeared, so that the fluid balance was quite similar between the two groups.\nThe increase in heart rate was greater in patients treated with dopamine than in patients treated with norepinephrine, up to 36 hours after randomization; the changes in the cardiac index, central venous pressure, venous oxygen saturation, and lactate levels were similar in the two groups.\nOutcome\nThe boundary for stopping the trial owing to the lack of evidence of a difference between treatments at a P value of 0.05 was crossed (Figure 5 in the Supplementary Appendix). There were no significant differences between the groups in the rate of death at 28 days or in the rates of death in the ICU, in the hospital, at 6 months, or at 12 months (Table 2). Kaplan–Meier curves for estimated survival showed no significant differences in the outcome (Figure 2). Cox proportional-hazards analyses that included the APACHE II score, sex, and other relevant variables yielded similar results (Figure 6 in the Supplementary Appendix). There were more days without need for the trial drug and more days without need for open-label vasopressors in the norepinephrine group than in the dopamine group, but there were no significant differences between the groups in the number of days without need for ICU care and in the number of days without need for organ support (Table 3). There were no significant differences in the causes of death between the two groups, although death from refractory shock occurred more frequently in the group of patients treated with dopamine than in the group treated with norepinephrine (P=0.05).\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan–Meier Curves for 28-Day Survival in the Intention-to-Treat Population.\nTable 2\n\nMortality Rates.\nTable 3\n\nSecondary Outcomes and Adverse Events.\nAdverse Events\nOverall, 309 patients (18.4%) had an arrhythmia; the most common type of arrhythmia was atrial fibrillation, which occurred in 266 patients (86.1%). More patients had an arrhythmia, especially atrial fibrillation, in the dopamine group than in the norepinephrine group (Table 3). The study drug was discontinued in 65 patients owing to severe arrhythmias — 52 patients (6.1%) in the dopamine group and 13 patients (1.6%) in the norepinephrine group (P<0.001). These patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. There were no significant differences between the groups in the incidences of other adverse events.\nAdditional Analyses\nA predefined subgroup analysis was conducted according to the type of shock — septic shock, which occurred in 1044 patients (542 in the dopamine group and 502 in the norepinephrine group); cardiogenic shock, which occurred in 280 patients (135 in the dopamine group and 145 in the norepinephrine group); or hypovolemic shock, which occurred in 263 patients (138 in the dopamine group and 125 in the norepinephrine group). The overall effect of treatment did not differ significantly among these subgroups (P=0.87 for interaction), although the rate of death at 28 days was significantly higher among patients with cardiogenic shock who were treated with dopamine than among those with cardiogenic shock who were treated with norepinephrine (P=0.03\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>EVENT<|>A severe medical condition characterized by a significant drop in blood pressure and organ dysfunction due to infection, treated in this study with dopamine or norepinephrine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOPAMINE GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of patients in the study who were treated with dopamine for shock management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOREPINEPHRINE GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of patients in the study who were treated with norepinephrine for shock management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARDIOGENIC SHOCK<|>EVENT<|>A type of shock resulting from heart failure, with a higher mortality rate in patients treated with dopamine in this study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK<|>EVENT<|>A type of shock caused by severe blood and fluid loss, treated in this study with dopamine or norepinephrine)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>DOPAMINE GROUP<|>Patients with septic shock were treated with dopamine in the study<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>NOREPINEPHRINE GROUP<|>Patients with septic shock were treated with norepinephrine in the study<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARDIOGENIC SHOCK<|>DOPAMINE GROUP<|>Patients with cardiogenic shock treated with dopamine had a higher mortality rate<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARDIOGENIC SHOCK<|>NOREPINEPHRINE GROUP<|>Patients with cardiogenic shock treated with norepinephrine had a lower mortality rate compared to those treated with dopamine<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK<|>DOPAMINE GROUP<|>Patients with hypovolemic shock were treated with dopamine in the study<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK<|>NOREPINEPHRINE GROUP<|>Patients with hypovolemic shock were treated with norepinephrine in the study<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
