Similar findings were observed in the subgroup stratified according to the interval between the time the patient met the clinical criteria for severe sepsis and treatment application.\nThe findings in our trial may appear to contradict those of the predefined subgroup analysis from the SAFE study,5 which suggested a survival advantage with an albumin-based strategy during severe sepsis. The plausibility of this hypothesis was supported by the significant hemodynamic advantages observed23 and by further investigations showing that the correction of hypoalbuminemia reduced the severity of organ dysfunction.4,6 Similar beneficial effects were also suggested by a large meta-analysis, which concluded that the use of albumin-containing solutions could be associated with lower mortality than that seen with other fluid regimens.24\nOur results confirm that administration of albumin produces small but significant hemodynamic advantages. A significantly greater proportion of patients in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group reached the targeted mean arterial pressure within 6 hours after randomization (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). During the first 7 days, the mean arterial pressure was higher, whereas the heart rate and net fluid balance were lower, in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group. Moreover, the average cardiovascular SOFA subscore over the course of the study period was lower in the albumin group, and the time to the suspension of inotropic or vasopressor agents was shorter, indicating a decreased use of vasopressors. These effects were obtained with similar amounts of administered fluids in the two study groups. These findings confirm a physiological advantage of albumin administration during severe sepsis, including a larger fluid distribution within the intravascular compartment and, in addition, possible effects of albumin as a scavenger of nitric oxide,12 mediating peripheral vasodilatation during sepsis.25,26\nThe secondary outcomes also provide a detailed profile of the safety of albumin administration during severe sepsis. The incidence of new organ failures during the study was similar in the two groups. We observed slightly higher average SOFA subscores for liver and coagulation in the albumin group, indicating a higher serum bilirubin and a lower platelet count, respectively, than were observed in the crystalloid group. Nonetheless, the absolute excess in the serum bilirubin concentration in the albumin group was marginal (median, 1.0 mg per deciliter [interquartile range, 0.6 to 1.7] vs. 0.9 mg per deciliter [interquartile range, 0.5 to 1.5], P<0.001) and was probably related to the methods used to prepare albumin solutions, which may be inefficient in clearing bilirubin content from plasma.21,27 The slight reduction in platelet counts in the albumin group may be a further marker of a larger expansion of the intravascular compartment in this group than in the crystalloid group, with a consequent dilution of the hemoglobin content (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nPost hoc univariate and multivariate analyses of data from the 1121 patients with septic shock showed significantly lower mortality at 90 days in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group. Conversely, in the subgroup of patients with severe sepsis without shock, mortality appeared to be higher among those who were treated with albumin than among those treated with crystalloids alone, although the difference was far from significant. This analysis was not prespecified, and therefore it may be characterized by well-known biases. Nonetheless, a state of shock associated with severe sepsis represents a well-defined clinical entity. Moreover, if the oncotic, antiinflammatory, and nitric oxide–scavenging properties of albumin are of clinical importance, these may be maximally exploited in the conditions that are the most severe, such as cardiovascular dysfunction.\nOur trial has certain limitations. First, we included the use of albumin solutions with a greater concentration than those used in the SAFE study (20% vs. 4%). Consequently, the volume of albumin solution that was administered was markedly lower than that administered in the SAFE study, since our goal was to correct hypoalbuminemia and not to directly replace intravascular volume. Second, the observed mortality at 28 days was lower than originally expected, thereby increasing the likelihood that the study was underpowered. Finally, only approximately one third of the patients were enrolled during the early phase of severe sepsis.\nIn conclusion, the use of albumin in addition to crystalloids to correct hypoalbuminemia, as compared with the use of crystalloids alone, in patients with severe sepsis during their stay in the ICU did not provide a survival benefit at 28 or 90 days, despite improvements in hemodynamic variables. The clinical benefit of albumin that was seen in the post hoc analysis of the subgroup of patients with septic shock warrants further confirmation.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAFE STUDY<|>EVENT<|>A study that suggested a survival advantage with an albumin-based strategy during severe sepsis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALBUMIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A protein used in medical treatments, particularly in the context of severe sepsis, for its hemodynamic advantages and potential nitric oxide-scavenging properties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRYSTALLOID<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of fluid regimen used in medical treatments, often compared with albumin in the context of severe sepsis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOFA SCORE<|>EVENT<|>A scoring system used to track a patient's status during sepsis, particularly focusing on organ function)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEVERE SEPSIS<|>EVENT<|>A critical medical condition characterized by a significant inflammatory response to infection, often requiring intensive care treatment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>EVENT<|>A severe and potentially fatal condition that occurs as a complication of sepsis, characterized by a significant drop in blood pressure and organ dysfunction)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALBUMIN<|>SAFE STUDY<|>The SAFE study suggested a survival advantage with an albumin-based strategy during severe sepsis<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALBUMIN<|>CRYSTALLOID<|>Albumin and crystalloids are compared in medical treatments for severe sepsis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALBUMIN<|>SEVERE SEPSIS<|>Albumin is used in the treatment of severe sepsis for its hemodynamic advantages<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALBUMIN<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>Albumin showed potential benefits in patients with septic shock, as indicated by post hoc analysis<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOFA SCORE<|>SEVERE SEPSIS<|>The SOFA score is used to assess organ function in patients with severe sepsis<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
