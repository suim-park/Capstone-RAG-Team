Protein C activity increased from baseline during the first 6 days in both groups; the mean increase was significantly greater in patients in the DrotAA group than in the placebo group on each of the first 4 study days (P<0.001) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nProbability of Survival and Odds Ratios for Death, According to Subgroup.\nTable 2\n\nStudy Outcomes and Adverse Events.\nDuring the first 28 days, one or more serious adverse events were recorded in 119 of 833 patients (14.3%) in the DrotAA group versus 96 of 833 patients (11.5%) in the placebo group (P=0.10) (Table 2, and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). During the treatment period, nonserious bleeding events were more common among patients receiving DrotAA than among those receiving placebo (in 72 of 833 patients [8.6%] vs. 40 of 833 [4.8%], P=0.002), as were serious bleeding events (in 10 of 833 patients [1.2%] vs. 8 of 833 [1.0%], P=0.81), although the latter difference was not significant.\nDiscussion\nIn this large international study involving critically ill adults with septic shock, DrotAA did not reduce mortality at either 28 or 90 days, as compared with placebo. The lack of benefit was consistent across predefined subgroups.\nThe strengths of the trial lie in both its design and its execution. From the results of previous randomized trials, we identified a clinically relevant population of patients who were likely to benefit from treatment with DrotAA, and we predefined a limited number of relevant subgroups within this population.1,3,12–18 The characteristics of the patients we recruited matched the population we targeted. The baseline characteristics indicated a high degree of disease severity: 97.5% had multiple organ dysfunction, 90.2% had metabolic acidosis, and more than half had an elevated lactate level that persisted after fluid resuscitation. The baseline protein C level was markedly reduced in many patients. All patients remained dependent on vasopressors at study entry; most were treated with norepinephrine, with a median dose of 21 to 24 μg per minute at the start of study treatment. The baseline APACHE II score (which was designed to estimate the risk of death among critically ill patients rather than to assess the eligibility of individual patients for particular treatments) was somewhat lower than expected. Similar APACHE II scores have been reported in a trial of treatments for septic shock,19 and such scores may reflect improved early resuscitation, since they are sensitive to lead-time bias.20,21\nWe used an adaptive design22 that allowed us to increase the sample size to maintain adequate statistical power, since some trials involving patients with severe sepsis showed lower-than-expected mortality.19,23,24 To reduce the risk of assignment bias, we concealed study-group assignments before and after randomization, and to minimize crossovers, we used a standardized process to select hospitals and intensive care units that did not regularly treat patients with DrotAA. The success of these processes is evident in the excellent compliance with study treatment and the minimal crossover observed in the study. We achieved near complete follow-up and followed a predefined, published statistical analysis plan. We used mortality as an outcome that is less subject to biased ascertainment than other outcomes.25 We focused on mortality at 90 days,18 since 45% of the patients were still hospitalized at 28 days, a percentage similar to that reported in the PROWESS study.\nOur trial also has some limitations. We did not collect comprehensive data to study the coagulation or inflammatory responses during infusion of the study drugs, although such data exist from previous trials.1,3,12,13,17,26 The between-group difference in protein C activity in our trial was similar to that seen in the PROWESS study,27,28 and this finding combined with the expected increase in nonserious bleeding events in the DrotAA group5,13 indicates that the patients received the intended treatment; both are indirect markers of the biologic activity of DrotAA. Mortality in the placebo group was low, as compared with historical data,1,29–31 but consistent with that observed in more recent observational studies32,33 and trials.34,35\nOur findings are consistent with results of the Administration of Drotrecogin Alfa (Activated) in Early Stage Severe Sepsis (ADDRESS) and the Resolution of Organ Failure in Pediatric Patients with Severe Sepsis (RESOLVE) trials, which showed that DrotAA did not reduce mortality in children or adults with severe sepsis who had a low risk of death.3,4 Our results are consistent with the finding in the ADDRESS trial in that DrotAA was not effective in patients with an increased disease severity.4 We cannot explain the inconsistency between our findings and the reduction in mortality at 28 days that was observed in the PROWESS study.1 Our findings of similar mortality at 90 days are consistent with those of the PROWESS study at 3 months, at which time mortality was not significantly reduced by DrotAA.36\nOur study showed that DrotAA was not beneficial when administered to a population of patients for which it was an approved treatment. The fact that we found no benefit in any of the prespecified subgroups should reassure clinicians who no longer have DrotAA available to treat patients with septic shock.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
