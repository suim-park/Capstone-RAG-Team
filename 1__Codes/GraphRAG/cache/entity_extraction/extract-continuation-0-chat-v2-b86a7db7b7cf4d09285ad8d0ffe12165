Additional sensitivity analyses were performed by adding the following covariates to the main logistic-regression model: sex; age; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, assessed on a scale from 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of death23; the time from the onset of shock to randomization; and the use of renal-replacement therapy in the 24 hours before randomization.\nThe primary outcome was also examined in six prespecified subgroups, which were defined according to the following baseline characteristics: admission type (medical vs. surgical); dose of catecholamine infusions (norepinephrine or epinephrine at a dose of <15 μg per minute vs. ≥15 μg per minute); primary site of sepsis (pulmonary vs. nonpulmonary); sex (male vs. female); APACHE II score (<25 vs. ≥25; a score of ≥25 has been used as a cutoff point to identify patients at a higher risk for death24,25); and the duration of shock according to four intervals of 6 hours each between 0 and 24 hours before randomization (<6 hours, 6 to 12 hours, 12 to 18 hours, or 18 to 24 hours). The secondary binary and continuous outcomes were analyzed with the use of logistic regression and linear regression, respectively, with adjustment for stratification variables. The rate of death in a time-to-event analysis was reported with the use of Kaplan–Meier plots, and differences in survival were tested with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model26 that included the randomized trial group, admission type, and a random effect for trial site.\nThe times to the resolution of shock and ventilation and the times to discharge from the ICU and the hospital were analyzed by means of two approaches: with death treated as a competing risk27 and with results described with the use of cumulative incidence function; and as a post hoc analysis with data from patients censored at the time of death and with results described with the use of Kaplan–Meier plots. Differences in the time to event (e.g., resolution of shock, cessation of ventilation, and ICU or hospital discharge) were tested with the use of the same Cox model that was used for the analysis of time to death.\nPhysiological data were averaged over the period of days 1 to 14 and compared with the use of a repeated-measure, linear mixed model and were presented as overall mean differences with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Post hoc analyses were performed with the use of a separate calculation of the mean differences over the period of days 1 to 7 (duration of trial regimen) and days 8 to 14. The proportions of patients who had adverse events and serious adverse events were compared with the use of Fisher’s exact test.\nAll the analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis with no imputation of missing data. For secondary outcomes, a post hoc Holm–Bonferroni procedure was applied to control for multiple testing.28 All the analyses were conducted with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\nTwo prespecified interim analyses were performed by an independent statistician when 950 patients (25%) and 2500 patients (66%) could be assessed with regard to the primary outcome at 90 days. These analyses were reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee.\nResults\nPatients\nFrom March 2013 through April 2017, we identified 5501 eligible patients, of whom 3800 were enrolled in the trial at 69 medical–surgical ICUs. The ICUs were in Australia (45 sites), the United Kingdom (12), New Zealand (8), Saudi Arabia (3), and Denmark (1).\nOf the 3800 patients enrolled, 1898 were assigned to receive hydrocortisone and 1902 to receive placebo. A total of 114 patients (3.0%) either withdrew (24 patients) or did not have informed consent obtained (90), and 28 of the remaining 3686 patients (0.8%) were lost to follow-up at 90 days. Thus, the trial included 3658 enrolled patients, of whom 1832 in the hydrocortisone group and 1826 in the placebo group were included in the analysis of the primary outcome (Figs. S1 and S2 and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nThe characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar in the two groups (Table 1). The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 62.3±14.9 years in the hydrocortisone group and 62.7±15.2 years in the placebo group; the percentages of male patients were 60.4% and 61.3%, respectively; the median APACHE II scores were 24.0 (interquartile range, 19.0 to 29.0) and 23.0 (interquartile range, 18.0 to 29.0), respectively; and the percentages of patients with surgical admission were 31.2% and 31.8%, respectively. The primary site of infection was similar in the two groups and was predominantly of pulmonary origin among patients with a medical diagnosis and of abdominal origin among patients with a surgical admission (Tables S6 and S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients at\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>Australia is one of the countries where the trial was conducted, with 45 medical-surgical ICU sites participating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>GEO<|>The United Kingdom is one of the countries where the trial was conducted, with 12 medical-surgical ICU sites participating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW ZEALAND<|>GEO<|>New Zealand is one of the countries where the trial was conducted, with 8 medical-surgical ICU sites participating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUDI ARABIA<|>GEO<|>Saudi Arabia is one of the countries where the trial was conducted, with 3 medical-surgical ICU sites participating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DENMARK<|>GEO<|>Denmark is one of the countries where the trial was conducted, with 1 medical-surgical ICU site participating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAS INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAS Institute is the organization that developed the SAS software used for data analysis in the trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Independent Data Monitoring Committee reviewed interim analyses of the trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDEPENDENT STATISTICIAN<|>PERSON<|>An independent statistician performed interim analyses for the trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The group of patients in the trial assigned to receive hydrocortisone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The group of patients in the trial assigned to receive a placebo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APACHE II SCORE<|>EVENT<|>A scoring system used to assess the severity of disease in patients, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of death)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|>HYDROCORTISONE GROUP<|>Australia was one of the countries where patients were enrolled in the hydrocortisone group<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>Australia was one of the countries where patients were enrolled in the placebo group<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>HYDROCORTISONE GROUP<|>The United Kingdom was one of the countries where patients were enrolled in the hydrocortisone group<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>The United Kingdom was one of the countries where patients were enrolled in the placebo group<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW ZEALAND<|>HYDROCORTISONE GROUP<|>New Zealand was one of the countries where patients were enrolled in the hydrocortisone group<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW ZEALAND<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>New Zealand was one of the countries where patients were enrolled in the placebo group<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAUDI ARABIA<|>HYDROCORTISONE GROUP<|>Saudi Arabia was one of the countries where patients were enrolled in the hydrocortisone group<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAUDI ARABIA<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>Saudi Arabia was one of the countries where patients were enrolled in the placebo group<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DENMARK<|>HYDROCORTISONE GROUP<|>Denmark was one of the countries where patients were enrolled in the hydrocortisone group<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DENMARK<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>Denmark was one of the countries where patients were enrolled in the placebo group<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAS INSTITUTE<|>INDEPENDENT STATISTICIAN<|>The independent statistician used SAS software for data analysis<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE<|>INDEPENDENT STATISTICIAN<|>The independent statistician's analyses were reviewed by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE GROUP<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>Both groups were part of the same clinical trial<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APACHE II SCORE<|>HYDROCORTISONE GROUP<|>APACHE II scores were used to assess the severity of patients in the hydrocortisone group<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APACHE II SCORE<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>APACHE II scores were used to assess the severity of patients in the placebo group<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
