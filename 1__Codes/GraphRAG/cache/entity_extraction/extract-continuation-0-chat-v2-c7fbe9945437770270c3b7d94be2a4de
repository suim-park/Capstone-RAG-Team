Secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality; days alive and free of organ dysfunction during the first 28 days according to the Brussels criteria16 (see the Supplementary Appendix); days alive and free of vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation, or renal replacement therapy; days alive and free of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, defined as freedom from two or more of the four diagnostic criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome; days alive and free of corticosteroid use; and length of stay in the ICU and hospital. We also evaluated rates of serious adverse events.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe calculated that 776 patients were required for enrollment, randomization, and receipt of the study drug in order to detect an absolute 10% difference in mortality, assuming a mortality rate of 60% in the norepinephrine group and a two-sided alpha error of 0.05 and a power of 80%. An independent data and safety monitoring committee evaluated two preplanned interim analyses, after 194 patients had been enrolled and after 388 patients had been enrolled. An O'Brien–Fleming approach was used for sequential stopping rules for safety and efficacy according to the Lan–DeMets method.17 After both interim analyses, the data and safety monitoring committee recommended that the study be continued without protocol modification.\nMidway through the trial, the executive committee, unaware of all data and in conference with the data and safety monitoring committee, determined that patients who had undergone randomization but had never received an infusion would not be included in the primary analysis, since their omission would be equally distributed between groups, would be unrelated to treatment assignment, and would not bias outcome ascertainment.18 We increased the total number of patients enrolled to maintain the target sample size after the removal of such patients from the analysis.\nThe primary analysis, which compared 28-day mortality between the two treatment groups, was performed with the use of an unadjusted chi-square test, and all patients were assessed according to the treatment received and to the treatment group assigned at randomization. Results are presented as absolute and relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Kaplan–Meier curves for the estimated probability of survival in the two treatment groups as a function of time from enrollment in the study were compared with the use of the log-rank test.\nBecause of the complex nature of septic shock and to account for any imbalances between the two treatment groups at baseline, a logistic-regression procedure and significant covariates that predicted outcomes were used to adjust raw values for 28-day mortality. Age, illness severity (score on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE II] at baseline), serious coexisting conditions, and other baseline covariates that predicted outcome (at a threshold P value of 0.20) were entered into the model. Results are presented as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We used parametric procedures (independent t-test), nonparametric procedures (Wilcoxon rank-sum test), or Fisher's exact test to compare all secondary outcomes.\nPatients were also assessed according to the a priori strata of more severe or less severe septic shock (as defined by the dose of norepinephrine) as well as in several exploratory analyses of shock severity defined by post hoc criteria. The treatment effect within each subgroup was assessed according to the within-stratum analysis, with the use of the chi-square test. We also used logistic-regression analysis to test for an interaction between stratum and treatment in order to determine whether there was a differential effect on mortality.\nThe data analyst and investigators remained unaware of the treatment assignments while undertaking the final analyses. Analysis was conducted with the use of SAS software (version 9.1.3), and all P values were two-sided.\nResults\nOf 6229 screened patients, 802 underwent randomization after providing informed consent (Figure 1). Of these 802 patients, 2 withdrew consent after infusion of the study drug and 21 did not receive the infusion for various reasons. In addition, one patient was lost to follow-up before day 28. Thus 779 patients underwent randomization and infusion of the study drug, and 778 were included in the final primary analysis: 396 in the vasopressin group and 382 in the norepinephrine group (Figure 1). The baseline characteristics of the two groups are shown in Table 1. Enrolled patients were severely ill, as indicated by the APACHE II scores,19 by the proportion with new organ dysfunction, by the serum lactate levels, and by the norepinephrine infusion rates at study entry.\nFigure 1\n\nEnrollment and Outcomes.\nTable 1\n\nDemographic and Baseline Characteristics of the Patients.\nBlood pressure in the two treatment groups was similar throughout the study, whereas the heart rate was significantly lower in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group during the first 4 days of treatment (P<0.001) (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The difference in the mean infusion rates of the study drug between treatment groups during the first 5 days was within 2 ml per hour. The rate of norepinephrine infusion was significantly lower in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group during the first 4 days (P<0.001) (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nThere was no significant difference in the primary outcome (rate of death from any cause, assessed 28 days after the start of infusions), between the vasopressin group and the norepinephrine group (35.4% and 39.3%, respectively; P=0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] for absolute risk reduction in the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRUSSELS CRITERIA<|>EVENT<|>The Brussels criteria are used to assess organ dysfunction during the first 28 days of treatment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>O'BRIEN–FLEMING APPROACH<|>EVENT<|>A statistical method used for sequential stopping rules for safety and efficacy in clinical trials)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAN–DEMETS METHOD<|>EVENT<|>A statistical method used in conjunction with the O'Brien–Fleming approach for interim analysis in clinical trials)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APACHE II<|>EVENT<|>The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II is a severity-of-disease classification system used to assess illness severity in patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAS SOFTWARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAS software is a statistical analysis system used for data analysis in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VASOPRESSIN GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of patients in the study receiving vasopressin as part of the treatment for septic shock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOREPINEPHRINE GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of patients in the study receiving norepinephrine as part of the treatment for septic shock)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRUSSELS CRITERIA<|>APACHE II<|>Both are used to assess the severity of illness and organ dysfunction in patients<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>O'BRIEN–FLEMING APPROACH<|>LAN–DEMETS METHOD<|>The O'Brien–Fleming approach is used with the Lan–DeMets method for interim analysis in clinical trials<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VASOPRESSIN GROUP<|>NOREPINEPHRINE GROUP<|>Both groups are part of the study comparing treatments for septic shock<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAS SOFTWARE<|>APACHE II<|>SAS software was used to analyze data including APACHE II scores<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
