The criteria for inclusion were fulfillment of two of four criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and a systolic blood pressure no higher than 90 mm Hg (after a crystalloid-fluid challenge of 20 to 30 ml per kilogram of body weight over a 30-minute period) or a blood lactate concentration of 4 mmol per liter or more. The criteria for exclusion from the study were an age of less than 18 years, pregnancy, or the presence of an acute cerebral vascular event, acute coronary syndrome, acute pulmonary edema, status asthmaticus, cardiac dysrhythmias (as a primary diagnosis), contraindication to central venous catheterization, active gastrointestinal hemorrhage, seizure, drug overdose, burn injury, trauma, a requirement for immediate surgery, uncured cancer (during chemotherapy), immunosuppression (because of organ transplantation or systemic disease), do-not-resuscitate status, or advanced directives restricting implementation of the protocol.\nFigure 1\n\nOverview of Patient Enrollment and Hemodynamic Support.\nThe clinicians who assessed the patients at this stage were unaware of the patients' treatment assignments. After written informed consent was obtained (in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration20), the patients were randomly assigned either to early goal-directed therapy or to standard (control) therapy in computer-generated blocks of two to eight. The study-group assignments were placed in sealed, opaque, randomly assorted envelopes, which were opened by a hospital staff member who was not one of the study investigators.\nTreatment\nThe patients were treated in a nine-bed unit in the emergency department by an emergency physician, two residents, and three nurses.3 The study was conducted during the routine treatment of other patients in the emergency department. After arterial and central venous catheterization, patients in the standard-therapy group were treated at the clinicians' discretion according to a protocol for hemodynamic support21 (Figure 1), with critical-care consultation, and were admitted for inpatient care as soon as possible. Blood, urine, and other relevant specimens for culture were obtained in the emergency department before the administration of antibiotics. Antibiotics were given at the discretion of the treating clinicians. Antimicrobial therapy was deemed adequate if the in vitro sensitivities of the identified microorganisms matched the particular antibiotic ordered in the emergency department.22\nThe patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy received a central venous catheter capable of measuring central venous oxygen saturation (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, Calif.); it was connected to a computerized spectrophotometer for continuous monitoring. Patients were treated in the emergency department according to a protocol for early goal-directed therapy (Figure 2) for at least six hours and were transferred to the first available inpatient beds. Monitoring of central venous oxygen saturation was then discontinued. Critical-care clinicians (intensivists, fellows, and residents providing 24-hour in-house coverage) assumed the care of all the patients; these physicians were unaware of the patients' study-group assignments. The study investigators did not influence patient care in the intensive care unit.\nFigure 2\n\nProtocol for Early Goal-Directed Therapy.\nThe protocol was as follows. A 500-ml bolus of crystalloid was given every 30 minutes to achieve a central venous pressure of 8 to 12 mm Hg. If the mean arterial pressure was less than 65 mm Hg, vasopressors were given to maintain a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mm Hg. If the mean arterial pressure was greater than 90 mm Hg, vasodilators were given until it was 90 mm Hg or below. If the central venous oxygen saturation was less than 70 percent, red cells were transfused to achieve a hematocrit of at least 30 percent. After the central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, and hematocrit were thus optimized, if the central venous oxygen saturation was less than 70 percent, dobutamine administration was started at a dose of 2.5 μg per kilogram of body weight per minute, a dose that was increased by 2.5 μg per kilogram per minute every 30 minutes until the central venous oxygen saturation was 70 percent or higher or until a maximal dose of 20 μg per kilogram per minute was given. Dobutamine was decreased in dose or discontinued if the mean arterial pressure was less than 65 mm Hg or if the heart rate was above 120 beats per minute. To decrease oxygen consumption, patients in whom hemodynamic optimization could not be achieved received mechanical ventilation and sedatives.\nOutcome Measures\nThe patients' temperature, heart rate, urine output, blood pressure, and central venous pressure were measured continuously for the first 6 hours of treatment and assessed every 12 hours for 72 hours. Arterial and venous blood gas values (including central venous oxygen saturation measured by in vitro co-oximetry; Nova Biomedical, Waltham, Mass.), lactate concentrations, and coagulation-related variables and clinical variables required for determination of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score (on a scale from 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction),23 the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II, on a scale from 0 to 174, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction),24 and the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS, on a scale from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction)25 were obtained at base line (0 hours) and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours.2,26 The results of laboratory tests required only for purposes of the study were made\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HELSINKI DECLARATION<|>EVENT<|>The Helsinki Declaration is a set of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Edwards Lifesciences is a company based in Irvine, California, that provides medical devices for monitoring central venous oxygen saturation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOVA BIOMEDICAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nova Biomedical is a company based in Waltham, Massachusetts, that provides in vitro co-oximetry for measuring central venous oxygen saturation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IRVINE<|>GEO<|>Irvine is a city in California where Edwards Lifesciences is located)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALTHAM<|>GEO<|>Waltham is a city in Massachusetts where Nova Biomedical is located)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES<|>IRVINE<|>Edwards Lifesciences is located in Irvine, California<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOVA BIOMEDICAL<|>WALTHAM<|>Nova Biomedical is located in Waltham, Massachusetts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HELSINKI DECLARATION<|>PATIENT ENROLLMENT<|>Patient enrollment was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
