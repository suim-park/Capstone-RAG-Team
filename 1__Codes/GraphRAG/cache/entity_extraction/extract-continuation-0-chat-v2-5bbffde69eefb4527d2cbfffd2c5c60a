A subgroup analysis of patients with CAP showed most effects in patients who had low basal cortisol levels combined with high proinflammatory cytokine profiles.32\n\nThe results from this study do not support an increased risk for secondary infections. Reasonable concerns were amplified by results of the CORTICUS trial, which showed higher numbers of secondary infections including new sepsis and septic shock in patients who received hydrocortisone.4 A Bayesian analysis, mainly based on CORTICUS results, of patients with septic shock reported an increased risk of infections.33 However, other studies in patients with septic shock,3 acute respiratory distress syndrome,34 trauma,35 or CAP8-10,30 and a meta-analysis7 did not report any increased risk.\n\nAn unexpected finding was that delirium developed less frequently in patients treated with hydrocortisone. Indeed, several observational studies reported an association between high serum cortisol concentration and delirium after noncardiac36 and cardiac 37 surgery and severe sepsis or septic shock.38 There is compelling evidence that systemic inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of delirium, but it remains controversial whether high cortisol concentration mirrors an activation of the stress response to cope with inflammation, or whether delirium is caused by high cortisol concentration. A prospective cohort study in 330 mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung injury reported a significant dose-independent association between systemic corticosteroid administration and development of delirium.39 However, in an RCT with 737 patients undergoing cardiac surgery who received dexamethasone, 1 mg/kg, or placebo at anesthesia induction did not reveal a significant difference of postoperative delirium between treatment groups.40 Thus, the results question the concept of cortisol-induced delirium in critical illness and provide some evidence of protective effects of prolonged administration of low-dose hydrocortisone in early severe sepsis.\n\nThere are limitations of the study to be addressed. First, inclusion in the trial was possible only after informed consent could be obtained, so that patients who developed septic shock early may have been missed. Second, data from corticotropin tests were available in a subgroup of 206 patients only, because adrenal function assessment was not an absolute inclusion criterion and therefore was not performed at all study sites or in all patients at a single site. Analyses of CIRCI were post hoc and should be regarded as hypothesis generating only. Third, mortality in the study population was more comparable to the mortality reported in recent studies with CAP9,10,30 than to the mortality (approximately 30%) reported in the study by Confalonieri et al8; thus, it cannot be excluded that hydrocortisone would have been more effective in patients with a higher risk of death. Fourth, data on delirium should be interpreted with caution because patients had to be excluded owing to incomplete data sets, only 1 daily assessment was performed in most patients, and interrater reliability was not assessed. Analyses were performed post hoc and results should therefore be regarded as hypothesis generating. Fifth, secondary analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing, as these statistical comparisons were performed with exploratory rather than confirmatory intention. Adjustment for clustering within site was not performed because site was a stratification factor for randomization. Sixth, the observed rate of septic shock in the placebo group (23%; 95% CI, 17%-30%) was lower than originally presumed for sample size calculation (40%). The point estimate of the difference of septic shock occurrences was −1.8% (ie, close to 0) with a 95% CI of −10.7% to 7.2%. Hence, the trial gives no indication of a clinically relevant major benefit of hydrocortisone treatment, which it was designed to detect.\n\nConclusions\nAmong adults with severe sepsis not in septic shock, the use of hydrocortisone compared with placebo did not reduce the risk of septic shock within 14 days. These findings do not support the use of hydrocortisone in these patients.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CORTICUS TRIAL<|>EVENT<|>The CORTICUS trial is a clinical study that investigated the effects of hydrocortisone on patients, showing higher numbers of secondary infections including new sepsis and septic shock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAYESIAN ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>A statistical analysis method used to assess the risk of infections in patients with septic shock, mainly based on CORTICUS results)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RCT<|>EVENT<|>A randomized controlled trial involving 737 patients undergoing cardiac surgery to assess the effects of dexamethasone on postoperative delirium)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONFALONIERI ET AL<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who conducted a study reporting approximately 30% mortality in patients with CAP)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CIRCI<|>EVENT<|>Critical Illness-Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency, a condition analyzed post hoc in the study)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORTICUS TRIAL<|>BAYESIAN ANALYSIS<|>The Bayesian analysis was mainly based on the results of the CORTICUS trial<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORTICUS TRIAL<|>RCT<|>The CORTICUS trial and the RCT both investigated the effects of corticosteroids on patients<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONFALONIERI ET AL<|>CIRCI<|>Confalonieri et al's study is referenced in the context of CIRCI analysis<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
