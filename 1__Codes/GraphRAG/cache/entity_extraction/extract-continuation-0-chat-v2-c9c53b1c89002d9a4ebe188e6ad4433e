We used a primary outcome that is not subject to observer bias. To further minimize bias, we published the statistical analysis plan15 and conducted all analyses, including post hoc analyses, before unmasking the study-group assignments. Although our predominantly nonsurgical patient population had low mortality, illness-severity scores were higher than those observed in a recent trial involving patients with septic shock.24 Moreover, our results are generalizable because we studied the broad population of ICU patients with infections who receive acetaminophen to treat fever in routine practice. We used the intravenous formulation of acetaminophen to eliminate any confounding that might be attributable to impaired and unpredictable enteral absorption.\nOur study has certain limitations. The median duration of study-drug administration was short, and approximately one third of the patients in each study group were exposed to acetaminophen in the ICU after the course of study-drug administration had been completed. Consequently, our study findings are relevant primarily to the early use of acetaminophen to treat fever in the ICU. We did not collect information about the use of acetaminophen before randomization or after ICU discharge. Protocol deviations were minor and were unlikely to have materially affected our findings.\nOur findings suggest that acetaminophen has a modest clinical effect as an antipyretic in ICU patients with fever and probable infection but does not reduce ICU-free days in these patients. Our observation that early administration of acetaminophen to treat fever is associated with a longer ICU stay than placebo among nonsurvivors and a shorter stay among survivors must be regarded as hypothesis-generating, thereby requiring caution in interpretation. Such findings may relate to the physiological effects of reducing fever3 and the way that these effects may influence clinicians’ perception of the patient’s illness severity, prognosis, or both. This perception may induce clinicians to discharge improving patients from the ICU faster and to support for a longer period of time patients who will ultimately succumb. An alternative or additional interpretation is that acetaminophen exerts biologically important effects on the natural history of sepsis.\nWe evaluated the administration of acetaminophen to treat fever and administered it for a relatively short period of time. Thus, our results do not preclude the possibility that a more prolonged course of acetaminophen may have a greater influence on patient-centered outcomes. Further studies are required to evaluate this possibility.\nIn conclusion, early administration of acetaminophen to treat fever due to probable infection did not affect the number of ICU-free days. There was no significant between-group difference in 28-day mortality, 90-day mortality, or survival time to day 90.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ICU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Intensive Care Unit, a specialized department in hospitals where critically ill patients receive treatment and monitoring)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACETAMINOPHEN<|>EVENT<|>A medication used to treat fever and pain, evaluated in this study for its effects on ICU patients with infections)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>EVENT<|>A severe and potentially fatal condition caused by an overwhelming immune response to infection, mentioned in comparison to the study's patient population)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ICU<|>ACETAMINOPHEN<|>Acetaminophen was administered to ICU patients to treat fever and its effects were studied<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACETAMINOPHEN<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>The study compared illness-severity scores of patients with those observed in a recent trial involving patients with septic shock<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
