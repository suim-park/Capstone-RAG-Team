The antiinflammatory activity of drotrecogin alfa activated may be mediated indirectly through the inhibition of the generation of thrombin, which leads to decreased activation of platelets, recruitment of neutrophils, and degranulation of mast cells.8 Furthermore, preclinical studies demonstrated that activated protein C has direct antiinflammatory properties, including the inhibition of neutrophil activation, the production of cytokines by lipopolysaccharide-challenged monocytes, and E-selectin–mediated adhesion of cells to vascular endothelium.32–34\nA consistent effect of treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated was seen among the subgroups examined, including those stratified according to age, APACHE II score, sex, number of dysfunctional organs or systems, type of infection (gram-positive, gram-negative, or mixed), site of infection, and presence or absence of protein C deficiency at study entry. Reductions in the relative risk of death were observed regardless of whether the patients had a deficiency of protein C at base line, suggesting that drotrecogin alfa activated has pharmacologic effects that go beyond simple physiologic replacement of activated protein C. This observation further suggests that measurements of protein C are not necessary to identify which patients would benefit from treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated. A consistent treatment effect was also observed regardless of the site of infection or the type of infection.\nIt was consistent with the antithrombotic activity of drotrecogin alfa activated that bleeding was the most common adverse event associated with the administration of the drug. The incidence of serious bleeding suggests that 1 additional serious bleeding event would occur for every 66 patients treated with drotrecogin alfa activated. Serious bleeding tended to occur in patients with predisposing conditions, such as gastrointestinal ulceration, traumatic injury of a blood vessel or highly vascular organ injury, or markedly abnormal values for indicators of coagulation (e.g., the platelet count, the activated partial-thromboplastin time, and the prothrombin time). The incidence of thrombotic events was not increased by treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated, and the antiinflammatory effect was not associated with an increased incidence of new infections. Treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated was not associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies against activated protein C.\nIn summary, the biologic activity of drotrecogin alfa activated was demonstrated by the finding of greater decreases in D-dimer and interleukin-6 levels in patients who received drotrecogin alfa activated than in those who received placebo. The higher incidence of serious bleeding during infusion in the drotrecogin alfa activated group is consistent with the antithrombotic activity of the drug and occurs predominantly in patients with a predisposition to bleeding. In patients with severe sepsis, an intravenous infusion of drotrecogin alfa activated at a dose of 24 μg per kilogram per hour for 96 hours was associated with a significant reduction in mortality and a safety profile that was acceptable within the context of this clinical trial.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DROTRECOGIN ALFA ACTIVATED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Drotrecogin alfa activated is a drug used in the treatment of severe sepsis, known for its antiinflammatory and antithrombotic properties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACTIVATED PROTEIN C<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Activated protein C is a protein with antiinflammatory properties, involved in the mechanism of action of drotrecogin alfa activated)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEVERE SEPSIS<|>EVENT<|>Severe sepsis is a life-threatening condition that drotrecogin alfa activated is used to treat, characterized by a significant reduction in mortality when treated with the drug)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DROTRECOGIN ALFA ACTIVATED<|>ACTIVATED PROTEIN C<|>Drotrecogin alfa activated exerts its effects through the antiinflammatory and antithrombotic properties of activated protein C<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DROTRECOGIN ALFA ACTIVATED<|>SEVERE SEPSIS<|>Drotrecogin alfa activated is used to treat severe sepsis, reducing mortality and having an acceptable safety profile<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
