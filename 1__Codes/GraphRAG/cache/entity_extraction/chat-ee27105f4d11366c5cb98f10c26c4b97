Lead investigators at a site could not serve as the bedside treating physician for patients in the usual-care group.\nOutcome Measures\nThe primary outcome of the study was the rate of in-hospital death from any cause at 60 days. Secondary mortality outcomes included the rate of death from any cause at 90 days and cumulative mortality at 90 days and 1 year. Other outcomes included the duration of acute cardiovascular failure (defined as the duration of the need for vasopressors), acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure (defined as the duration of mechanical ventilation or dialysis during the acute hospitalization, truncated at 60 days, in patients who had not had a long-term need for ventilation or dialysis before enrollment); the duration of the stay in the hospital and intensive care unit; and hospital discharge disposition (i.e., discharge to a long-term or other acute care facility, a nursing home, a private home, or other). We collected information on serious adverse events using standard federal guidelines.13\nStatistical Analysis\nWe analyzed all data according to the intention-to-treat principle. For the primary outcome, our design tested sequentially whether protocol-based resuscitation (EGDT or standard therapy) was superior to usual care and, if it was, whether protocol-based EGDT was superior to protocol-based standard therapy. We initially calculated that with a sample of 1950 patients, the study would have at least 80% power to detect a reduction in mortality of 6 to 7 percentage points, at an alpha level of 0.05 for both hypotheses, assuming mortality of 30 to 46% with usual care; interim analyses were planned after 650 patients and 1300 patients had been enrolled. The trial did not meet the stopping criteria at the first planned interim analysis (after the enrollment of 650 patients). Before the second interim analysis, we observed that the overall mortality was approximately 20%, which was much lower than anticipated but consistent with the results of a recent study involving similar patients.14 After consultation with the data and safety monitoring board and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and with the group assignments still concealed, we calculated that we would need to enroll a total of 1350 patients to preserve the same power for the same absolute risk reduction.\nAfter spending 0.0005 alpha for the first interim analysis, and after recalculation of the sample size (which removed the requirement for a second interim analysis), the alpha level required for the sequential hypotheses was 0.0494, with no adjustment for multiple testing. We tested for between-group differences in the primary outcome using Fisher's exact test. In the event that protocol-based care (EGDT and standard therapy combined) was not superior to usual care, all other analyses were to be specified as secondary. Because of possible site heterogeneity, we also conducted a secondary analysis using a generalized linear mixed model in which we allowed for a random effect of study site, with treatment group as a covariate; assessed significance with the use of type 3 tests; and used compound symmetry for the covariance structure.\nFor other end points, we used Fisher's exact test for categorical outcomes and an analysis of variance for continuous outcomes. For survival analyses, we generated Kaplan–Meier estimates, assessed between-group differences using the log-rank test, and expressed the data as cumulative mortality curves. In prespecified subgroup analyses, we used the Breslow–Day test to assess interactions between treatment assignment and subgroups defined according to age, sex, race, source of infection, and enrollment criterion (refractory hypotension or elevated serum lactate level). We also conducted post hoc subgroup analyses according to thirds of values for the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, for the baseline serum lactate level, and for the time from detection of shock until randomization, using logistic regression to test for an interaction between treatment assignment and subgroups. Unless otherwise specified, analyses are for tests of differences across the three study groups, with P values of less than 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. We used SAS software, version 9.3, for all analyses.\nResults\nPatients\nFrom March 2008 through May 2013, we enrolled 1351 patients (Figure 1, and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Ten patients who provided informed consent later requested complete withdrawal from the study, leaving a final cohort of 1341 patients for the analysis: 439 in the protocol-based EGDT group, 446 in the protocol-based standard-therapy group, and 456 in the usual-care group. The three groups were well matched at baseline with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as the care received before randomization (Table 1, and Tables S1, S2, and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 1\n\nScreening, Randomization, and Follow-up.\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\nAdherence to the Protocol\nAdherence to the protocol was high in both protocol-based groups. At 6 hours, incomplete adherence was recorded in 48 of 404 patients in the EGDT group (11.9%) and 19 of 435 patients in the standard-therapy group (4.4%) who could be evaluated (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). In most of the patients who had been randomly assigned to EGDT, a central venous catheter for monitoring of ScvO2 was placed promptly (Fig. S6A in the Supplementary Appendix).
