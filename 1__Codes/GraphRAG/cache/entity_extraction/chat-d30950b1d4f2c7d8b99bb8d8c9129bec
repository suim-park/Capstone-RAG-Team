This approach involves adjustments of cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility to balance oxygen delivery with oxygen demand. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of early goal-directed therapy before admission to the intensive care unit.\nMethods\nWe randomly assigned patients who arrived at an urban emergency department with severe sepsis or septic shock to receive either six hours of early goal-directed therapy or standard therapy (as a control) before admission to the intensive care unit. Clinicians who subsequently assumed the care of the patients were blinded to the treatment assignment. In-hospital mortality (the primary efficacy outcome), end points with respect to resuscitation, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores were obtained serially for 72 hours and compared between the study groups.\nResults\nOf the 263 enrolled patients, 130 were randomly assigned to early goal-directed therapy and 133 to standard therapy; there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to base-line characteristics. In-hospital mortality was 30.5 percent in the group assigned to early goal-directed therapy, as compared with 46.5 percent in the group assigned to standard therapy (P=0.009). During the interval from 7 to 72 hours, the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy had a significantly higher mean (±SD) central venous oxygen saturation (70.4±10.7 percent vs. 65.3±11.4 percent), a lower lactate concentration (3.0±4.4 vs. 3.9±4.4 mmol per liter), a lower base deficit (2.0±6.6 vs. 5.1±6.7 mmol per liter), and a higher pH (7.40±0.12 vs. 7.36±0.12) than the patients assigned to standard therapy (P≤0.02 for all comparisons). During the same period, mean APACHE II scores were significantly lower, indicating less severe organ dysfunction, in the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy than in those assigned to standard therapy (13.0±6.3 vs. 15.9±6.4, P<0.001).\nConclusions\nEarly goal-directed therapy provides significant benefits with respect to outcome in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.\nThe systemic inflammatory response syndrome can be self-limited or can progress to severe sepsis and septic shock.1 Along this continuum, circulatory abnormalities (intravascular volume depletion, peripheral vasodilatation, myocardial depression, and increased metabolism) lead to an imbalance between systemic oxygen delivery and oxygen demand, resulting in global tissue hypoxia or shock.2 An indicator of serious illness, global tissue hypoxia is a key development preceding multiorgan failure and death.2 The transition to serious illness occurs during the critical “golden hours,” when definitive recognition and treatment provide maximal benefit in terms of outcome. These golden hours may elapse in the emergency department,3 hospital ward,4 or the intensive care unit.5\nEarly hemodynamic assessment on the basis of physical findings, vital signs, central venous pressure,6 and urinary output7 fails to detect persistent global tissue hypoxia. A more definitive resuscitation strategy involves goal-oriented manipulation of cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility to achieve a balance between systemic oxygen delivery and oxygen demand.2 End points used to confirm the achievement of such a balance (hereafter called resuscitation end points) include normalized values for mixed venous oxygen saturation, arterial lactate concentration, base deficit, and pH.8 Mixed venous oxygen saturation has been shown to be a surrogate for the cardiac index as a target for hemodynamic therapy.9 In cases in which the insertion of a pulmonary-artery catheter is impractical, venous oxygen saturation can be measured in the central circulation.10\nWhereas the incidence of septic shock has steadily increased during the past several decades, the associated mortality rates have remained constant or have decreased only slightly.11 Studies of interventions such as immunotherapy,12 hemodynamic optimization,9,13 or pulmonary-artery catheterization14 enrolled patients up to 72 hours after admission to the intensive care unit. The negative results of studies of the use of hemodynamic variables as end points (“hemodynamic optimization”), in particular, prompted suggestions that future studies involve patients with similar causes of disease13 or with global tissue hypoxia (as reflected by elevated lactate concentrations)15 and that they examine interventions begun at an earlier stage of disease.16,17\nWe examined whether early goal-directed therapy before admission to the intensive care unit effectively reduces the incidence of multiorgan dysfunction, mortality, and the use of health care resources among patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.\nMethods\nApproval of Study Design\nThis prospective, randomized study was approved by the institutional review board for human research and was conducted under the auspices of an independent safety, efficacy, and data monitoring committee.\nEligibility\nEligible adult patients who presented to the emergency department of an 850-bed academic tertiary care hospital with severe sepsis, septic shock, or the sepsis syndrome from March 1997 through March 2000 were assessed for possible enrollment according to the inclusion18,19 and exclusion criteria (Figure 1). The criteria for inclusion were fulfillment of two of four criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and a systolic blood pressure no higher than 90 mm Hg (after a crystalloid-fluid challenge of 20 to 30 ml per kilogram of body weight over a 30-minute period) or a blood lactate concentration of 4 mmol per liter or more. The criteria for exclusion from the study were an age\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
