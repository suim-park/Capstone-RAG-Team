(Details about methods are provided in the Statistical Analysis section in the Supplementary Appendix.)\nResults\nStudy Patients\nFrom February 16, 2011, to July 24, 2014, we screened 6192 patients at 56 sites (including 29% that are teaching hospitals), which resulted in the enrollment of 1260 patients (Tables S1 and S2 and Fig. S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Four patients requested complete withdrawal and five were ineligible, which left 1251 patients in the initial analysis (625 in the EGDT group and 626 in the usual-care group). Eight patients withdrew before 90 days, which left 1243 patients in the analysis of outcomes (623 in the EGDT group and 620 in the usual-care group) (Figure 1, and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The two study groups were well matched at baseline (Table 1, and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 1\n\nEnrollment and Outcomes.\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\nThe criterion for refractory hypotension was met in 338 patients (54.1%) in the EGDT group and 348 patients (55.6%) in the usual-care group, and the criterion for hyperlactatemia was met in 409 patients (65.4%) and 399 patients (63.7%), respectively. The intravenous-fluid volume before randomization was similar in the two groups, as were median times from presentation at the emergency department until inclusion criteria were met and until randomization. Only about two thirds of patients in either group were deemed likely to be admitted to the ICU from the emergency department if they were not enrolled in the study; those deemed unlikely to be admitted were less severely ill. The sites of infection (most commonly lung) were well balanced in the two groups. All patients received antimicrobial drugs before randomization.\nAdherence to the Protocol\nMost patients in the EGDT group underwent timely insertion of a central venous catheter capable of continuous ScvO2 monitoring. Two catheters that were inserted in error in the usual-care group were not used for monitoring ScvO2 (Table 2, and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the EGDT group, reasons for failure of insertion were as follows: patient no longer met inclusion criteria or met exclusion criteria (22 patients), there was a lapse in the process of care (lack of equipment, staff, beds, communication, or error) (20 patients), there were technical difficulties or problems with a patient (18 patients), there was a decision by a clinician (9 patients), or the patient declined to have a catheter inserted but did not withdraw from the trial (5 patients); in 4 patients, no reason was provided, and 2 patients died before catheter insertion. The mean (±SD) first ScvO2 value recorded (at hour 1) was 70±12% (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Standard central venous catheters were not mandated but were placed in 50.9% of the patients in the usual-care group, and ScvO2 was measured from aspirated blood samples in 6 patients. Arterial catheters were also not mandated but were placed in most patients.\nTable 2\n\nInterventions Delivered during and after the 6-Hour Intervention Period.\nEGDT was stopped prematurely in 21 patients (median time to cessation, 3 hours) because active treatment was withdrawn (9 patients), the patient was no longer considered to have sepsis (5 patients), or EGDT was terminated in error (3 patients); in addition, 1 patient was transferred to an operating room, 1 patient declined treatment, and no reason was provided for 2 patients. Among the 35 patients who died within 6 hours (17 in the EGDT group and 18 in the usual-care group), 5 in the EGDT group and 6 in the usual-care group had withdrawal of active treatment. Adherence to EGDT ranged from 86 to 95%, depending on the method of assessment (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nIntervention Period\nDuring the 6-hour intervention period, patients in the EGDT group received more intravenous fluids than did patients in the usual-care group (Table 2). Hourly fluid volume decreased over the 6 hours, but patients in the usual-care group received a larger initial volume (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). Crystalloids were administered more frequently than colloids in the two groups. More patients in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group received vasopressors and dobutamine. Although more patients in the EGDT group received red-cell transfusions, larger volumes were transfused in the usual-care group. During the 6-hour intervention period, administration of platelets and fresh-frozen plasma was similar in the two groups, although the volume of each was higher in the EGDT group (Table 2). At 6 hours, values for central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, and hemoglobin were similar in the two groups among patients in whom they were measured, which happened with greater frequency in the EGDT group (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nAfter the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EGDT<|>EVENT<|>EGDT, or Early Goal-Directed Therapy, is a treatment protocol used in the study to manage patients with sepsis, involving interventions like central venous catheter insertion and administration of fluids and medications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>EVENT<|>The usual-care group refers to the control group in the study that received standard treatment for sepsis without the specific interventions of the EGDT protocol)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATA/SE SOFTWARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stata/SE software, version 13.0, is a statistical software used for data analysis in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Supplementary Appendix provides additional details and data supporting the study's findings, including statistical analysis and patient data)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>The EGDT group and the usual-care group are the two study groups compared in the research to evaluate the effectiveness of the EGDT protocol<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STATA/SE SOFTWARE<|>SUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIX<|>Stata/SE software was used to perform the statistical analyses detailed in the Supplementary Appendix<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
