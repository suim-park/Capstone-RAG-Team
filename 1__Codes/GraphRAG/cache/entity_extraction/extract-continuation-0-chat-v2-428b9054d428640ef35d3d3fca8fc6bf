In a previous study, drotrecogin alfa activated produced dose-dependent reductions in the levels of markers of coagulation and inflammation in patients with severe sepsis. In this phase 3 trial, we assessed whether treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated reduced the rate of death from any cause among patients with severe sepsis.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Patients with systemic inflammation and organ failure due to acute infection were enrolled and assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of either placebo or drotrecogin alfa activated (24 μg per kilogram of body weight per hour) for a total duration of 96 hours. The prospectively defined primary end point was death from any cause and was assessed 28 days after the start of the infusion. Patients were monitored for adverse events; changes in vital signs, laboratory variables, and the results of microbiologic cultures; and the development of neutralizing antibodies against activated protein C.\nResults\nA total of 1690 randomized patients were treated (840 in the placebo group and 850 in the drotrecogin alfa activated group). The mortality rate was 30.8 percent in the placebo group and 24.7 percent in the drotrecogin alfa activated group. On the basis of the prospectively defined primary analysis, treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated was associated with a reduction in the relative risk of death of 19.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6.6 to 30.5) and an absolute reduction in the risk of death of 6.1 percent (P=0.005). The incidence of serious bleeding was higher in the drotrecogin alfa activated group than in the placebo group (3.5 percent vs. 2.0 percent, P=0.06).\nConclusions\nTreatment with drotrecogin alfa activated significantly reduces mortality in patients with severe sepsis and may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.\nSevere sepsis, defined as sepsis associated with acute organ dysfunction, results from a generalized inflammatory and procoagulant response to an infection.1 The rate of death from severe sepsis ranges from 30 to 50 percent despite advances in critical care.2–5 In the United States, approximately 750,000 cases of sepsis occur each year, at least 225,000 of which are fatal.6\nThe inflammatory and procoagulant host responses to infection are closely related.7 Inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6, are capable of activating coagulation and inhibiting fibrinolysis, whereas the procoagulant thrombin is capable of stimulating multiple inflammatory pathways.7–11 The end result may be diffuse endovascular injury, multiorgan dysfunction, and death. Activated protein C, an endogenous protein that promotes fibrinolysis and inhibits thrombosis and inflammation, is an important modulator of the coagulation and inflammation associated with severe sepsis (Figure 1).18 Activated protein C is converted from its inactive precursor, protein C, by thrombin coupled to thrombomodulin.18 The conversion of protein C to activated protein C may be impaired during sepsis as a result of the down-regulation of thrombomodulin by inflammatory cytokines.19 Reduced levels of protein C are found in the majority of patients with sepsis and are associated with an increased risk of death.20–23\nFigure 1\n\nProposed Actions of Activated Protein C in Modulating the Systemic Inflammatory, Procoagulant, and Fibrinolytic Host Responses to Infection.\nPrevious preclinical and clinical studies showed that the administration of activated protein C may improve the outcome of severe sepsis. The administration of activated protein C was protective in a baboon model of lethal Escherichia coli sepsis.24 In a placebo-controlled phase 2 trial in patients with severe sepsis, an infusion of drotrecogin alfa (activated), or recombinant human activated protein C (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis), hereafter referred to as drotrecogin alfa activated, resulted in dose-dependent reductions in the plasma levels of D-dimer and serum levels of interleukin-6, markers of coagulopathy and inflammation, respectively.25 We therefore evaluated whether the administration of drotrecogin alfa activated would reduce the rate of death from all causes at 28 days in patients with severe sepsis and have an acceptable safety profile.\nMethods\nPatients\nFrom July 1998 through June 2000, eligible patients were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, which was conducted at 164 centers in 11 countries. The institutional review board at each center approved the protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their authorized representatives. The clinical coordinating center (Vanderbilt Coordinating Center, Nashville) was available 24 hours a day throughout the study to answer investigators' questions regarding patients' eligibility and safety and the reporting of serious adverse events.\nSelection Criteria\nThe criteria for severe sepsis were a modification of those defined by Bone et al. (Appendix 1).26 Patients were eligible for the trial if they had a known or suspected infection on the basis of clinical data at the time of screening and if they met the following criteria within a 24-hour period: three or more signs of systemic inflammation and the sepsis-induced\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DROTRECOGIN ALFA ACTIVATED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Drotrecogin alfa activated, also known as recombinant human activated protein C, is a treatment with antithrombotic, antiinflammatory, and profibrinolytic properties used in a phase 3 trial to reduce mortality in severe sepsis patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEVERE SEPSIS<|>EVENT<|>Severe sepsis is a condition characterized by sepsis associated with acute organ dysfunction, resulting from a generalized inflammatory and procoagulant response to an infection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANDERBILT COORDINATING CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Vanderbilt Coordinating Center in Nashville served as the clinical coordinating center for the trial, providing 24-hour support for patient eligibility and safety inquiries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a country where approximately 750,000 cases of sepsis occur each year, with at least 225,000 being fatal)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DROTRECOGIN ALFA ACTIVATED<|>SEVERE SEPSIS<|>Drotrecogin alfa activated was used in a trial to treat patients with severe sepsis, aiming to reduce mortality<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VANDERBILT COORDINATING CENTER<|>DROTRECOGIN ALFA ACTIVATED<|>The Vanderbilt Coordinating Center provided support for the trial involving drotrecogin alfa activated<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>SEVERE SEPSIS<|>Severe sepsis is a significant health issue in the United States, with a high incidence and mortality rate<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
