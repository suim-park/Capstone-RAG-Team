In the albumin group, the target serum albumin concentration was 30 g per liter or more until discharge from the ICU or 28 days after randomization. The primary outcome was death from any cause at 28 days. Secondary outcomes were death from any cause at 90 days, the number of patients with organ dysfunction and the degree of dysfunction, and length of stay in the ICU and the hospital.\nResults\nDuring the first 7 days, patients in the albumin group, as compared with those in the crystalloid group, had a higher mean arterial pressure (P=0.03) and lower net fluid balance (P<0.001). The total daily amount of administered fluid did not differ significantly between the two groups (P=0.10). At 28 days, 285 of 895 patients (31.8%) in the albumin group and 288 of 900 (32.0%) in the crystalloid group had died (relative risk in the albumin group, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87 to 1.14; P=0.94). At 90 days, 365 of 888 patients (41.1%) in the albumin group and 389 of 893 (43.6%) in the crystalloid group had died (relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.05; P=0.29). No significant differences in other secondary outcomes were observed between the two groups.\nConclusions\nIn patients with severe sepsis, albumin replacement in addition to crystalloids, as compared with crystalloids alone, did not improve the rate of survival at 28 and 90 days. (Funded by the Italian Medicines Agency; ALBIOS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00707122.)\nFor decades, human albumin has been administered to patients to provide adequate oncotic pressure and intravascular volume.1 In 1998, however, a report from the Cochrane Injuries Group Albumin Reviewers indicated that the administration of albumin may be potentially harmful in critically ill patients, as compared with the administration of crystalloid solutions.2 Subsequent meta-analyses reported contradictory findings.3,4\nTo clarify this issue, a large, double-blind, randomized trial (the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation [SAFE] study)5 was conducted, in which 4% albumin solution was compared with normal saline as fluid replacement in critically ill patients, with results indicating that albumin administration was safe. A predefined subgroup analysis showed that patients with severe sepsis receiving albumin were at a lower, although not significantly lower, risk for death than those receiving normal saline. In addition, a subsequent study pointed out a potential benefit of maintaining serum albumin at a level of more than 30 g per liter in critically ill patients.6\nThere is a convincing rationale for the potential advantages of albumin administration during severe sepsis.7 Albumin is the main protein responsible for plasma colloid osmotic pressure8; it acts as a carrier for several endogenous and exogenous compounds,9 with antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties, and as a scavenger of reactive oxygen10,11 and nitrogen12 species and operates as a buffer molecule for acid–base equilibrium.13 We therefore conducted a randomized, controlled trial to investigate the effects of the administration of albumin and crystalloids, as compared with crystalloids alone, targeting a serum albumin level of 30 g per liter or more in a population of patients with severe sepsis.\nMethods\nStudy Oversight and Design\nWe conducted the Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis (ALBIOS) study — an investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial — in 100 intensive care units (ICUs) in Italy. The members of the steering committee (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) designed the study, were responsible for its execution and for the data analysis, made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication, and assume responsibility for the fidelity of the study to the protocol (available at NEJM.org).\nThe trial was funded by the Italian Medicines Agency, which had no role in the conduct of the study, the reporting of the data, or the supply of study fluids. Albumin administered during the study was provided by each participating institution as part of the clinical treatment of critically ill patients. The study protocol and the informed-consent process were approved by the ethics committee at each participating institution. Written informed consent or deferred consent was obtained from each patient.\nRandomization was performed centrally, with the use of a computer-generated and blinded assignment sequence. Randomization was stratified according to the participating ICU and the interval between the time that the patient met the clinical criteria for severe sepsis and randomization. The conduct of the trial was overseen by the data and safety monitoring board, which performed an interim analysis after the enrollment of 700 patients.\nPatients\nPatients 18 years of age or older who met the clinical criteria for severe sepsis14 within the previous 24 hours at any time during their stay in the ICU were enrolled in the study after being screened for eligibility criteria. Details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\nStudy Treatments\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive either 20% albumin and crystalloid\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
